# detective-chatbot

This repository was created by Dr. Veronica Red (they/them) as a repository for a chatbot that takes in Public Domain detective novels, specifically Sherlock Holmes, Hardy Boys, and Hercule Poirot, and returns a recounting of a mystery that includes some details given my the user and told in the voice of one of the three detectives (or pair of detectives as Hardy Boys is a pair) or answers a question in the voice of the character selected. 

This chatbot is both a labor of love and an entry to Nvidia Generative AI Agents Developer Contest.
