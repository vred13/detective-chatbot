In this case I decided on Public Domain detective novels, specifically those that focused on a single detective or team of detectives as the main detection force.  That narrowed things down a bit for the data, I have a full set of Sherlock Holmes works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 6 books from The Hardy Boys series by Franklin W. Dixon, and 9 of the works detailing the escapades of Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie.  \n"

From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt\\\\nwhether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see\\\\nthe loom of the opposite houses.  The first day Holmes had spent in\\\\ncross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had\\\\nbeen patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his\\\\nhobby--the music of the Middle Ages.  But when, for the fourth time,\\\\nafter pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy\\\\nbrown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon\\\\nthe window-panes, my comrade\\\\'s impatient and active nature could endure\\\\nthis drab existence no longer.  He paced restlessly about our\\\\nsitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping\\\\nthe furniture, and chafing against inaction.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nI was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of\\\\ncriminal interest.  There was the news of a revolution, of a possible\\\\nwar, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come\\\\nwithin the horizon of my companion.  I could see nothing recorded in\\\\nthe shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile.  Holmes\\\\ngroaned and resumed his restless meanderings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,\\\" said he in the\\\\nquerulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. \\\"Look out\\\\nthis window, Watson.  See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and\\\\nthen blend once more into the cloud-bank.  The thief or the murderer\\\\ncould roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen\\\\nuntil he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There have,\\\" said I, \\\"been numerous petty thefts.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes snorted his contempt.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than\\\\nthat,\\\" said he.  \\\"It is fortunate for this community that I am not a\\\\ncriminal.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It is, indeed!\\\" said I heartily.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who\\\\nhave good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against\\\\nmy own pursuit?  A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over.\\\\nIt is well they don\\\\'t have days of fog in the Latin countries--the\\\\ncountries of assassination.  By Jove! here comes something at last to\\\\nbreak our dead monotony.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIt was the maid with a telegram.  Holmes tore it open and burst out\\\\nlaughing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Well, well!  What next?\\\" said he.  \\\"Brother Mycroft is coming round.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Why not?  It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane.\\\\nMycroft has his rails and he runs on them.  His Pall Mall lodgings, the\\\\nDiogenes Club, Whitehall--that is his cycle.  Once, and only once, he\\\\nhas been here.  What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Does he not explain?\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes handed me his brother\\\\'s telegram.\\\\n\\\\n    \\\"Must see you over Cadogan West.  Coming at once.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n     MYCROFT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Cadogan West?  I have heard the name.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It recalls nothing to my mind.  But that Mycroft should break out in\\\\nthis erratic fashion!  A planet might as well leave its orbit.  By the\\\\nway, do you know what Mycroft is?\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the\\\\nAdventure of the Greek Interpreter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"You told me that he had some small office under the British\\\\ngovernment.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes chuckled.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I did not know you quite so well in those days.  One has to be\\\\ndiscreet when one talks of high matters of state.  You are right in\\\\nthinking that he is under the British government.  You would also be right\\\\nin a sense if you said that occasionally he IS the British government.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"My dear Holmes!\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I thought I might surprise you.  Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty\\\\npounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind,\\\\nwill receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most\\\\nindispensable man in the country.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But how?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Well, his position is unique.  He has made it for himself. There has\\\\nnever been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the\\\\ntidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing\\\\nfacts, of any man living.  The same great powers which I have turned to\\\\nthe detection of crime he has used for this particular business.  The\\\\nconclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the\\\\ncentral exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance.  All\\\\nother men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience.  We will\\\\nsuppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves\\\\nthe Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his\\\\nseparate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft\\\\ncan focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the\\\\nother.  They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he\\\\nhas made himself an essential.  In that great brain of his everything\\\\nis pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.  Again and again\\\\nhis word has decided the national policy.  He lives in it.  He thinks\\\\nof nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I\\\\ncall upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems.\\\\nBut Jupiter is descending to-day.  What on earth can it mean?  Who is\\\\nCadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I have it,\\\" I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the\\\\nsofa.  \\\"Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!  Cadogan West was the young\\\\nman who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"This must be serious, Watson.  A death which has caused my brother to\\\\nalter his habits can be no ordinary one.  What in the world can he have\\\\nto do with it?  The case was featureless as I remember it.  The young\\\\nman had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself.  He had\\\\nnot been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect\\\\nviolence.  Is that not so?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There has been an inquest,\\\" said I, \\\"and a good many fresh facts have\\\\ncome out.  Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a\\\\ncurious case.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a\\\\nmost extraordinary one.\\\"  He snuggled down in his armchair. \\\"Now,\\\\nWatson, let us have the facts.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The man\\\\'s name was Arthur Cadogan West.  He was twenty-seven years of\\\\nage, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Government employ.  Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night.  Was last seen by his\\\\nfiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about\\\\n7:30 that evening.  There was no quarrel between them and she can give\\\\nno motive for his action.  The next thing heard of him was when his\\\\ndead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside\\\\nAldgate Station on the Underground system in London.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"When?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The body was found at six on Tuesday morning.  It was lying wide of\\\\nthe metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a\\\\npoint close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in\\\\nwhich it runs.  The head was badly crushed--an injury which might well\\\\nhave been caused by a fall from the train.  The body could only have\\\\ncome on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any\\\\nneighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a\\\\ncollector is always standing.  This point seems absolutely certain.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Very good.  The case is definite enough.  The man, dead or alive,\\\\neither fell or was precipitated from a train.  So much is clear to me.\\\\nContinue.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was\\\\nfound are those which run from west to east, some being purely\\\\nMetropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions.  It can\\\\nbe stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was\\\\ntravelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at\\\\nwhat point he entered the train it is impossible to state.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"His ticket, of course, would show that.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There was no ticket in his pockets.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No ticket!  Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According\\\\nto my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a\\\\nMetropolitan train without exhibiting one\\\\'s ticket. Presumably, then,\\\\nthe young man had one.  Was it taken from him in order to conceal the\\\\nstation from which he came?  It is possible.  Or did he drop it in the\\\\ncarriage?  That is also possible.  But the point is of curious\\\\ninterest.  I understand that there was no sign of robbery?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Apparently not.  There is a list here of his possessions.  His purse\\\\ncontained two pounds fifteen.  He had also a check-book on the Woolwich\\\\nbranch of the Capital and Counties Bank.  Through this his identity was\\\\nestablished.  There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich\\\\nTheatre, dated for that very evening.  Also a small packet of technical\\\\npapers.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There we have it at last, Watson!  British government--Woolwich.\\\\nArsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.  But\\\\nhere he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered\\\\ninto the room.  Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of\\\\nuncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame\\\\nthere was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its\\\\nsteel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its\\\\nplay of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross\\\\nbody and remembered only the dominant mind.\\\\n\\\\nAt his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and\\\\naustere.  The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.\\\\nThe detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out\\\\nof his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"A most annoying business, Sherlock,\\\" said he.  \\\"I extremely dislike\\\\naltering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial.  In\\\\nthe present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from\\\\nthe office.  But it is a real crisis.  I have never seen the Prime\\\\nMinister so upset.  As to the Admiralty--it is buzzing like an\\\\noverturned bee-hive.  Have you read up the case?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We have just done so.  What were the technical papers?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Ah, there\\\\'s the point!  Fortunately, it has not come out.  The press\\\\nwould be furious if it did.  The papers which this wretched youth had\\\\nin his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the\\\\nimportance of the subject.  His brother and I sat expectant.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Surely you have heard of it?  I thought everyone had heard of it.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Only as a name.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.  It has been the most\\\\njealously guarded of all government secrets.  You may take it from me\\\\nthat naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a\\\\nBruce-Partington\\\\'s operation.  Two years ago a very large sum was\\\\nsmuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly\\\\nof the invention.  Every effort has been made to keep the secret.  The\\\\nplans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate\\\\npatents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an\\\\nelaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with\\\\nburglar-proof doors and windows.  Under no conceivable circumstances\\\\nwere the plans to be taken from the office.  If the chief constructor\\\\nof the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the\\\\nWoolwich office for the purpose.  And yet here we find them in the\\\\npocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.  From an official\\\\npoint of view it\\\\'s simply awful.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But you have recovered them?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No, Sherlock, no!  That\\\\'s the pinch.  We have not.  Ten papers were\\\\ntaken from Woolwich.  There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West.\\\\nThe three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished.  You must drop\\\\neverything, Sherlock.  Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the\\\\npolice-court.  It\\\\'s a vital international problem that you have to\\\\nsolve.  Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing\\\\nones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the\\\\nevil be set right?  Find an answer to all these questions, and you will\\\\nhave done good service for your country.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?  You can see as far as I.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Possibly, Sherlock.  But it is a question of getting details. Give me\\\\nyour details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent\\\\nexpert opinion.  But to run here and run there, to cross-question\\\\nrailway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye--it is not my\\\\nmetier.  No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up.  If you\\\\nhave a fancy to see your name in the next honours list--\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMy friend smiled and shook his head.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I play the game for the game\\\\'s own sake,\\\" said he.  \\\"But the problem\\\\ncertainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased\\\\nto look into it.  Some more facts, please.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper,\\\\ntogether with a few addresses which you will find of service.  The\\\\nactual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert,\\\\nSir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a\\\\nbook of reference.  He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a\\\\nfavoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose\\\\npatriotism is beyond suspicion.  He is one of two who have a key of the\\\\nsafe.  I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during\\\\nworking hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three\\\\no\\\\'clock taking his key with him.  He was at the house of Admiral\\\\nSinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this\\\\nincident occurred.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Has the fact been verified?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his\\\\ndeparture from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London;\\\\nso Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Who was the other man with a key?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson.  He is a man of\\\\nforty, married, with five children.  He is a silent, morose man, but he\\\\nhas, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service.  He is\\\\nunpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker.  According to his own\\\\naccount, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the\\\\nwhole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left\\\\nthe watch-chain upon which it hangs.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Tell us about Cadogan West.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He has been ten years in the service and has done good work.  He has\\\\nthe reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight,\\\\nhonest man.  We have nothing against him.  He was next Sidney Johnson\\\\nin the office.  His duties brought him into daily, personal contact\\\\nwith the plans.  No one else had the handling of them.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Who locked up the plans that night?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.  They are\\\\nactually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West.\\\\nThat seems final, does it not?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained.  In the\\\\nfirst place, why did he take them?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I presume they were of value?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London\\\\nexcept to sell them?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No, I cannot.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.  Young West took the\\\\npapers.  Now this could only be done by having a false key--\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Several false keys.  He had to open the building and the room.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He had, then, several false keys.  He took the papers to London to\\\\nsell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back\\\\nin the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on\\\\nthis treasonable mission he met his end.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"How?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was\\\\nkilled and thrown out of the compartment.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station\\\\nLondon Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London\\\\nBridge.  There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he\\\\nwas having an absorbing interview.  This interview led to a violent\\\\nscene in which he lost his life.  Possibly he tried to leave the\\\\ncarriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end.  The other closed\\\\nthe door.  There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet\\\\nconsider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched.  We will suppose, for\\\\nargument\\\\'s sake, that young Cadogan West HAD determined to convey these\\\\npapers to London.  He would naturally have made an appointment with the\\\\nforeign agent and kept his evening clear.  Instead of that he took two\\\\ntickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then\\\\nsuddenly disappeared.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"A blind,\\\" said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to\\\\nthe conversation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"A very singular one.  That is objection No. 1.  Objection No. 2: We\\\\nwill suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent.  He\\\\nmust bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be\\\\ndiscovered.  He took away ten.  Only seven were in his pocket.  What\\\\nhad become of the other three?  He certainly would not leave them of\\\\nhis own free will.  Then, again, where is the price of his treason?\\\\nOnce would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It seems to me perfectly clear,\\\" said Lestrade.  \\\"I have no doubt at\\\\nall as to what occurred.  He took the papers to sell them.  He saw the\\\\nagent. They could not agree as to price.  He started home again, but\\\\nthe agent went with him.  In the train the agent murdered him, took the\\\\nmore essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage.  That\\\\nwould account for everything, would it not?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Why had he no ticket?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent\\\\'s\\\\nhouse.  Therefore he took it from the murdered man\\\\'s pocket.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Good, Lestrade, very good,\\\" said Holmes.  \\\"Your theory holds together.\\\\nBut if this is true, then the case is at an end.  On the one hand, the\\\\ntraitor is dead.  On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington\\\\nsubmarine are presumably already on the Continent.  What is there for\\\\nus to do?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"To act, Sherlock--to act!\\\" cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \\\"All\\\\nmy instincts are against this explanation.  Use your powers! Go to the\\\\nscene of the crime!  See the people concerned!  Leave no stone\\\\nunturned!  In all your career you have never had so great a chance of\\\\nserving your country.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Well, well!\\\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \\\"Come, Watson!\\\\nAnd you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or\\\\ntwo?  We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station.\\\\nGood-bye, Mycroft.  I shall let you have a report before evening, but I\\\\nwarn you in advance that you have little to expect.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAn hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground\\\\nrailroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately\\\\nbefore Aldgate Station.  A courteous red-faced old gentleman\\\\nrepresented the railway company.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"This is where the young man\\\\'s body lay,\\\" said he, indicating a spot\\\\nabout three feet from the metals.  \\\"It could not have fallen from\\\\nabove, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could\\\\nonly have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it,\\\\nmust have passed about midnight on Monday.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No record of a door being found open?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"None.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\\\" said Lestrade. \\\"A\\\\npassenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about\\\\n11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body\\\\nstriking the line, just before the train reached the station.  There\\\\nwas dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen.  He made no report\\\\nof it at the time.  Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMy friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon\\\\nhis face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the\\\\ntunnel.  Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points.  On\\\\nthese his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen,\\\\nalert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils,\\\\nand concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Points,\\\" he muttered; \\\"the points.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What of it?  What do you mean?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as\\\\nthis?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No; they are very few.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"And a curve, too.  Points, and a curve.  By Jove! if it were only so.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What is it, Mr. Holmes?  Have you a clue?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"An idea--an indication, no more.  But the case certainly grows in\\\\ninterest.  Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?  I do not see any\\\\nindications of bleeding on the line.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There were hardly any.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"And yet one would have expected some bleeding.  Would it be possible\\\\nfor me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the\\\\nthud of a fall in the fog?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I fear not, Mr. Holmes.  The train has been broken up before now, and\\\\nthe carriages redistributed.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said Lestrade, \\\"that every carriage has\\\\nbeen carefully examined.  I saw to it myself.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIt was one of my friend\\\\'s most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient\\\\nwith less alert intelligences than his own.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Very likely,\\\" said he, turning away.  \\\"As it happens, it was not the\\\\ncarriages which I desired to examine.  Watson, we have done all we can\\\\nhere.  We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.  I think our\\\\ninvestigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he\\\\nhanded to me before dispatching it.  It ran thus:\\\\n\\\\nSee some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out.\\\\nMeanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a\\\\ncomplete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be\\\\nin England, with full address.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"That should be helpful, Watson,\\\" he remarked as we took our seats in\\\\nthe Woolwich train.  \\\"We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for\\\\nhaving introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable\\\\ncase.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHis eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung\\\\nenergy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had\\\\nopened up a stimulating line of thought.  See the foxhound with hanging\\\\nears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it\\\\nwith the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it\\\\nruns upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in Holmes since the\\\\nmorning.  He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in\\\\nthe mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a\\\\nfew hours before round the fog-girt room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There is material here.  There is scope,\\\" said he.  \\\"I am dull indeed\\\\nnot to have understood its possibilities.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Even now they are dark to me.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead\\\\nus far.  The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the ROOF\\\\nof a carriage.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"On the roof!\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Remarkable, is it not?  But consider the facts.  Is it a coincidence\\\\nthat it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as\\\\nit comes round on the points?  Is not that the place where an object\\\\nupon the roof might be expected to fall off?  The points would affect\\\\nno object inside the train.  Either the body fell from the roof, or a\\\\nvery curious coincidence has occurred.  But now consider the question\\\\nof the blood.  Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body\\\\nhad bled elsewhere.  Each fact is suggestive in itself.  Together they\\\\nhave a cumulative force.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"And the ticket, too!\\\" I cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Exactly.  We could not explain the absence of a ticket.  This would\\\\nexplain it.  Everything fits together.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling\\\\nthe mystery of his death.  Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Perhaps,\\\" said Holmes, thoughtfully, \\\"perhaps.\\\"  He relapsed into a\\\\nsilent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in\\\\nWoolwich Station.  There he called a cab and drew Mycroft\\\\'s paper from\\\\nhis pocket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\\\" said he.  \\\"I\\\\nthink that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns\\\\nstretching down to the Thames.  As we reached it the fog was lifting,\\\\nand a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through.  A butler answered\\\\nour ring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Sir James, sir!\\\" said he with solemn face.  \\\"Sir James died this\\\\nmorning.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Good heavens!\\\" cried Holmes in amazement.  \\\"How did he die?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel\\\\nValentine?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, we had best do so.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWe were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we\\\\nwere joined by a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the\\\\nyounger brother of the dead scientist.  His wild eyes, stained cheeks,\\\\nand unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the\\\\nhousehold.  He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It was this horrible scandal,\\\" said he.  \\\"My brother, Sir James, was a\\\\nman of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair.\\\\nIt broke his heart.  He was always so proud of the efficiency of his\\\\ndepartment, and this was a crushing blow.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would\\\\nhave helped us to clear the matter up.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to\\\\nall of us.  He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the\\\\npolice.  Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty.  But\\\\nall the rest was inconceivable.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard.  I have no\\\\ndesire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we\\\\nare much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this\\\\ninterview to an end.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"This is indeed an unexpected development,\\\" said my friend when we had\\\\nregained the cab.  \\\"I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the\\\\npoor old fellow killed himself!  If the latter, may it be taken as some\\\\nsign of self-reproach for duty neglected?  We must leave that question\\\\nto the future.  Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the\\\\nbereaved mother.  The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any\\\\nuse to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced\\\\nherself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the\\\\nlast to see him upon that fatal night.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\\\" she said.  \\\"I have not shut an eye\\\\nsince the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what\\\\nthe true meaning of it can be.  Arthur was the most single-minded,\\\\nchivalrous, patriotic man upon earth.  He would have cut his right hand\\\\noff before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.  It is\\\\nabsurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But the facts, Miss Westbury?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Was he in any want of money?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample.  He had saved a\\\\nfew hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No signs of any mental excitement?  Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely\\\\nfrank with us.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner.  She\\\\ncoloured and hesitated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she said at last, \\\"I had a feeling that there was something on\\\\nhis mind.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"For long?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Only for the last week or so.  He was thoughtful and worried. Once I\\\\npressed him about it.  He admitted that there was something, and that\\\\nit was concerned with his official life.  \\\\'It is too serious for me to\\\\nspeak about, even to you,\\\\' said he.  I could get nothing more.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes looked grave.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Go on, Miss Westbury.  Even if it seems to tell against him, go on.\\\\nWe cannot say what it may lead to.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Indeed, I have nothing more to tell.  Once or twice it seemed to me\\\\nthat he was on the point of telling me something.  He spoke one evening\\\\nof the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he\\\\nsaid that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMy friend\\\\'s face grew graver still.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Anything else?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He said that we were slack about such matters--that it would be easy\\\\nfor a traitor to get the plans.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, quite recently.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Now tell us of that last evening.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We were to go to the theatre.  The fog was so thick that a cab was\\\\nuseless.  We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly\\\\nhe darted away into the fog.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Without a word?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He gave an exclamation; that was all.  I waited but he never returned.\\\\nThen I walked home.  Next morning, after the office opened, they came\\\\nto inquire.  About twelve o\\\\'clock we heard the terrible news.  Oh, Mr.\\\\nHolmes, if you could only, only save his honour!  It was so much to\\\\nhim.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes shook his head sadly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Come, Watson,\\\" said he, \\\"our ways lie elsewhere.  Our next station\\\\nmust be the office from which the papers were taken.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries\\\\nmake it blacker,\\\" he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \\\"His coming\\\\nmarriage gives a motive for the crime.  He naturally wanted money.  The\\\\nidea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl\\\\nan accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans.  It is all very\\\\nbad.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But surely, Holmes, character goes for something?  Then, again, why\\\\nshould he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a\\\\nfelony?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Exactly!  There are certainly objections.  But it is a formidable case\\\\nwhich they have to meet.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received\\\\nus with that respect which my companion\\\\'s card always commanded.  He\\\\nwas a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard,\\\\nand his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been\\\\nsubjected.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad!  Have you heard of the death of the\\\\nchief?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We have just come from his house.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The place is disorganized.  The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our\\\\npapers stolen.  And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we\\\\nwere as efficient an office as any in the government service.  Good\\\\nGod, it\\\\'s dreadful to think of!  That West, of all men, should have\\\\ndone such a thing!\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"You are sure of his guilt, then?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I can see no other way out of it.  And yet I would have trusted him as\\\\nI trust myself.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"At what hour was the office closed on Monday?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"At five.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Did you close it?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I am always the last man out.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Where were the plans?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"In that safe.  I put them there myself.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Is there no watchman to the building?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an\\\\nold soldier and a most trustworthy man.  He saw nothing that evening.\\\\nOf course the fog was very thick.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building\\\\nafter hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could\\\\nreach the papers?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, he would.  The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and\\\\nthe key of the safe.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I had no keys of the doors--only of the safe.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, I think he was.  I know that so far as those three keys are\\\\nconcerned he kept them on the same ring.  I have often seen them there.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"And that ring went with him to London?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He said so.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"And your key never left your possession?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Never.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate.  And yet\\\\nnone was found upon his body.  One other point:  if a clerk in this\\\\noffice desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the\\\\nplans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an\\\\neffective way.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical\\\\nknowledge?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"No doubt we had, but I beg you won\\\\'t try to drag me into the matter,\\\\nMr. Holmes.  What is the use of our speculating in this way when the\\\\noriginal plans were actually found on West?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking\\\\noriginals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have\\\\nequally served his turn.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Singular, no doubt--and yet he did so.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable.  Now there\\\\nare three papers still missing.  They are, as I understand, the vital\\\\nones.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, that is so.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without\\\\nthe seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I reported to that effect to the Admiralty.  But to-day I have been\\\\nover the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it.  The double valves\\\\nwith the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers\\\\nwhich have been returned.  Until the foreigners had invented that for\\\\nthemselves they could not make the boat.  Of course they might soon get\\\\nover the difficulty.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"But the three missing drawings are the most important?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Undoubtedly.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the\\\\npremises.  I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHe examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the\\\\niron shutters of the window.  It was only when we were on the lawn\\\\noutside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush\\\\noutside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having\\\\nbeen twisted or snapped.  He examined them carefully with his lens, and\\\\nthen some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath.  Finally he asked\\\\nthe chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me\\\\nthat they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for\\\\nanyone outside to see what was going on within the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The indications are ruined by three days\\\\' delay.  They may mean\\\\nsomething or nothing.  Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can\\\\nhelp us further.  It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see\\\\nif we can do better in London.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nYet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich\\\\nStation.  The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with\\\\nconfidence that he saw Cadogan West--whom he knew well by sight--upon\\\\nthe Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London\\\\nBridge.  He was alone and took a single third-class ticket.  The clerk\\\\nwas struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner.  So shaky was\\\\nhe that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped\\\\nhim with it.  A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the\\\\nfirst train which it was possible for West to take after he had left\\\\nthe lady about 7:30.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Let us reconstruct, Watson,\\\" said Holmes after half an hour of\\\\nsilence.  \\\"I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever\\\\nhad a case which was more difficult to get at.  Every fresh advance\\\\nwhich we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely\\\\nmade some appreciable progress.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against\\\\nyoung Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend\\\\nthemselves to a more favourable hypothesis.  Let us suppose, for\\\\nexample, that he had been approached by some foreign agent.  It might\\\\nhave been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from\\\\nspeaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the\\\\ndirection indicated by his remarks to his fiancee.  Very good.  We will\\\\nnow suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he\\\\nsuddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the\\\\ndirection of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his\\\\ndecisions.  Everything gave way to his duty.  He followed the man,\\\\nreached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued\\\\nthe thief.  In this way we get over the objection that no one would\\\\ntake originals when he could make copies.  This outsider had to take\\\\noriginals. So far it holds together.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What is the next step?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Then we come into difficulties.  One would imagine that under such\\\\ncircumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the\\\\nvillain and raise the alarm.  Why did he not do so? Could it have been\\\\nan official superior who took the papers? That would explain West\\\\'s\\\\nconduct.  Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and\\\\nWest started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms,\\\\npresuming that he knew where the rooms were?  The call must have been\\\\nvery pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no\\\\neffort to communicate with her.  Our scent runs cold here, and there is\\\\na vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West\\\\'s body,\\\\nwith seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.\\\\nMy instinct now is to work from the other end.  If Mycroft has given us\\\\nthe list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two\\\\ntracks instead of one.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSurely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street.  A government\\\\nmessenger had brought it post-haste.  Holmes glanced at it and threw it\\\\nover to me.\\\\n\\\\nThere are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an\\\\naffair.  The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great\\\\nGeorge Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions,\\\\nNotting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington.\\\\nThe latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as\\\\nhaving left.  Glad to hear you have seen some light.  The Cabinet\\\\nawaits your final report with the utmost anxiety.  Urgent\\\\nrepresentations have arrived from the very highest quarter.  The whole\\\\nforce of the State is at your back if you should need it.\\\\n\\\\nMycroft.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I\\\\'m afraid,\\\" said Holmes, smiling, \\\"that all the queen\\\\'s horses and\\\\nall the queen\\\\'s men cannot avail in this matter.\\\"  He had spread out\\\\nhis big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \\\"Well, well,\\\" said he\\\\npresently with an exclamation of satisfaction, \\\"things are turning a\\\\nlittle in our direction at last.  Why, Watson, I do honestly believe\\\\nthat we are going to pull it off, after all.\\\"  He slapped me on the\\\\nshoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity.  \\\"I am going out now.  It is\\\\nonly a reconnaissance.  I will do nothing serious without my trusted\\\\ncomrade and biographer at my elbow.  Do you stay here, and the odds are\\\\nthat you will see me again in an hour or two.  If time hangs heavy get\\\\nfoolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well\\\\nthat he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour\\\\nunless there was good cause for exultation.  All the long November\\\\nevening I waited, filled with impatience for his return.  At last,\\\\nshortly after nine o\\\\'clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:\\\\n\\\\nAm dining at Goldini\\\\'s Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please\\\\ncome at once and join me there.  Bring with you a jemmy, a dark\\\\nlantern, a chisel, and a revolver.\\\\n\\\\nS.H.\\\\n\\\\nIt was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the\\\\ndim, fog-draped streets.  I stowed them all discreetly away in my\\\\novercoat and drove straight to the address given.  There sat my friend\\\\nat a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Have you had something to eat?  Then join me in a coffee and curacao.\\\\nTry one of the proprietor\\\\'s cigars.  They are less poisonous than one\\\\nwould expect.  Have you the tools?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"They are here, in my overcoat.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Excellent.  Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with\\\\nsome indication of what we are about to do.  Now it must be evident to\\\\nyou, Watson, that this young man\\\\'s body was PLACED on the roof of the\\\\ntrain.  That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that\\\\nit was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I should say it was impossible.  If you examine the roofs you will\\\\nfind that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round\\\\nthem.  Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was\\\\nplaced on it.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"How could he be placed there?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"That was the question which we had to answer.  There is only one\\\\npossible way.  You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels\\\\nat some points in the West End.  I had a vague memory that as I have\\\\ntravelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head.\\\\nNow, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be\\\\nany difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It seems most improbable.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies\\\\nfail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.  Here\\\\nall other contingencies HAVE failed.  When I found that the leading\\\\ninternational agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses\\\\nwhich abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a\\\\nlittle astonished at my sudden frivolity.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Oh, that was it, was it?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, that was it.  Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had\\\\nbecome my objective.  I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station,\\\\nwhere a very helpful official walked with me along the track and\\\\nallowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of\\\\nCaulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact\\\\nthat, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the\\\\nUnderground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at\\\\nthat very spot.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Splendid, Holmes!  You have got it!\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"So far--so far, Watson.  We advance, but the goal is afar. Well,\\\\nhaving seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and\\\\nsatisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown.  It is a considerable\\\\nhouse, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms.\\\\nOberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a\\\\nconfederate entirely in his confidence.  We must bear in mind that\\\\nOberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not\\\\nwith any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and\\\\nthe idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to\\\\nhim.  Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Hardly on the evidence.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What can we hope to do?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I don\\\\'t like it, Holmes.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street.  I\\\\'ll do the\\\\ncriminal part.  It\\\\'s not a time to stick at trifles.  Think of\\\\nMycroft\\\\'s note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who\\\\nwaits for news.  We are bound to go.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMy answer was to rise from the table.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"You are right, Holmes.  We are bound to go.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHe sprang up and shook me by the hand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I knew you would not shrink at the last,\\\" said he, and for a moment I\\\\nsaw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had\\\\never seen.  The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once\\\\nmore.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.  Let us walk,\\\" said\\\\nhe.  \\\"Don\\\\'t drop the instruments, I beg.  Your arrest as a suspicious\\\\ncharacter would be a most unfortunate complication.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nCaulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and\\\\nporticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle\\\\nVictorian epoch in the West End of London.  Next door there appeared to\\\\nbe a children\\\\'s party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the\\\\nclatter of a piano resounded through the night.  The fog still hung\\\\nabout and screened us with its friendly shade.  Holmes had lit his\\\\nlantern and flashed it upon the massive door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"This is a serious proposition,\\\" said he.  \\\"It is certainly bolted as\\\\nwell as locked.  We would do better in the area.  There is an excellent\\\\narchway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.\\\\nGive me a hand, Watson, and I\\\\'ll do the same for you.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA minute later we were both in the area.  Hardly had we reached the\\\\ndark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog\\\\nabove.  As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower\\\\ndoor.  I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew\\\\nopen.  We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door\\\\nbehind us.  Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair.  His\\\\nlittle fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Here we are, Watson--this must be the one.\\\"  He threw it open, and as\\\\nhe did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud\\\\nroar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light\\\\nalong the window-sill.  It was thickly coated with soot from the\\\\npassing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"You can see where they rested the body.  Halloa, Watson! what is this?\\\\nThere can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.\\\"  He was pointing to\\\\nfaint discolourations along the woodwork of the window.  \\\"Here it is on\\\\nthe stone of the stair also.  The demonstration is complete.  Let us\\\\nstay here until a train stops.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWe had not long to wait.  The very next train roared from the tunnel as\\\\nbefore, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes,\\\\npulled up immediately beneath us.  It was not four feet from the\\\\nwindow-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the\\\\nwindow.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"So far we are justified,\\\" said he.  \\\"What do you think of it, Watson?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"A masterpiece.  You have never risen to a greater height.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I cannot agree with you there.  From the moment that I conceived the\\\\nidea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very\\\\nabstruse one, all the rest was inevitable.  If it were not for the\\\\ngrave interests involved the affair up to this point would be\\\\ninsignificant.  Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we\\\\nmay find something here which may help us.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWe had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon\\\\nthe first floor.  One was a dining-room, severely furnished and\\\\ncontaining nothing of interest.  A second was a bedroom, which also\\\\ndrew blank.  The remaining room appeared more promising, and my\\\\ncompanion settled down to a systematic examination.  It was littered\\\\nwith books and papers, and was evidently used as a study.  Swiftly and\\\\nmethodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and\\\\ncupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his\\\\naustere face.  At the end of an hour he was no further than when he\\\\nstarted.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The cunning dog has covered his tracks,\\\" said he.  \\\"He has left\\\\nnothing to incriminate him.  His dangerous correspondence has been\\\\ndestroyed or removed.  This is our last chance.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIt was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes\\\\npried it open with his chisel.  Several rolls of paper were within,\\\\ncovered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what\\\\nthey referred.  The recurring words, \\\"water pressure\\\" and \\\"pressure to\\\\nthe square inch\\\" suggested some possible relation to a submarine.\\\\nHolmes tossed them all impatiently aside.  There only remained an\\\\nenvelope with some small newspaper slips inside it.  He shook them out\\\\non the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had\\\\nbeen raised.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What\\\\'s this, Watson?  Eh?  What\\\\'s this?  Record of a series of\\\\nmessages in the advertisements of a paper.  Daily Telegraph agony\\\\ncolumn by the print and paper.  Right-hand top corner of a page. No\\\\ndates--but messages arrange themselves.  This must be the first:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Hoped to hear sooner.  Terms agreed to.  Write fully to address given\\\\non card.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Next comes:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Too complex for description.  Must have full report, Stuff awaits you\\\\nwhen goods delivered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Then comes:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Matter presses.  Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make\\\\nappointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Finally:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Monday night after nine.  Two taps.  Only ourselves.  Do not be so\\\\nsuspicious.  Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"A fairly complete record, Watson!  If we could only get at the man at\\\\nthe other end!\\\"  He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the\\\\ntable.  Finally he sprang to his feet.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Well, perhaps it won\\\\'t be so difficult, after all.  There is nothing\\\\nmore to be done here, Watson.  I think we might drive round to the\\\\noffices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day\\\\'s work to a\\\\nconclusion.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after\\\\nbreakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our\\\\nproceedings of the day before.  The professional shook his head over\\\\nour confessed burglary.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We can\\\\'t do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said he. \\\"No\\\\nwonder you get results that are beyond us.  But some of these days\\\\nyou\\\\'ll go too far, and you\\\\'ll find yourself and your friend in trouble.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson?  Martyrs on the altar of our\\\\ncountry.  But what do you think of it, Mycroft?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Excellent, Sherlock!  Admirable!  But what use will you make of it?\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHolmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Have you seen Pierrot\\\\'s advertisement to-day?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What?  Another one?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Yes, here it is:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"To-night.  Same hour.  Same place.  Two taps.  Most vitally important.\\\\nYour own safety at stake.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"By George!\\\" cried Lestrade.  \\\"If he answers that we\\\\'ve got him!\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"That was my idea when I put it in.  I think if you could both make it\\\\nconvenient to come with us about eight o\\\\'clock to Caulfield Gardens we\\\\nmight possibly get a little nearer to a solution.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his\\\\npower of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his\\\\nthoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he\\\\ncould no longer work to advantage.  I remember that during the whole of\\\\nthat memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had\\\\nundertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.  For my own part I had\\\\nnone of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared\\\\nto be interminable.  The great national importance of the issue, the\\\\nsuspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we\\\\nwere trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.  It was a relief to me\\\\nwhen at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition.\\\\nLestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester\\\\nRoad Station.  The area door of Oberstein\\\\'s house had been left open\\\\nthe night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes\\\\nabsolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in\\\\nand open the hall door.  By nine o\\\\'clock we were all seated in the\\\\nstudy, waiting patiently for our man.\\\\n\\\\nAn hour passed and yet another.  When eleven struck, the measured beat\\\\nof the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes.\\\\nLestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a\\\\nminute at their watches.  Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids\\\\nhalf shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a\\\\nsudden jerk.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He is coming,\\\" said he.\\\\n\\\\nThere had been a furtive step past the door.  Now it returned. We heard\\\\na shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker.\\\\nHolmes rose, motioning us to remain seated.  The gas in the hall was a\\\\nmere point of light.  He opened the outer door, and then as a dark\\\\nfigure slipped past him he closed and fastened it.  \\\"This way!\\\" we\\\\nheard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us.  Holmes had\\\\nfollowed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and\\\\nalarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room.\\\\nBefore our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and\\\\nHolmes standing with his back against it.  The man glared round him,\\\\nstaggered, and fell senseless upon the floor.  With the shock, his\\\\nbroad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his\\\\nlips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome\\\\ndelicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes gave a whistle of surprise.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,\\\" said he.  \\\"This was\\\\nnot the bird that I was looking for.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Who is he?\\\" asked Mycroft eagerly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the\\\\nSubmarine Department.  Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is\\\\ncoming to.  I think that you had best leave his examination to me.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWe had carried the prostrate body to the sofa.  Now our prisoner sat\\\\nup, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand\\\\nover his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What is this?\\\" he asked.  \\\"I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Everything is known, Colonel Walter,\\\" said Holmes.  \\\"How an English\\\\ngentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension.\\\\nBut your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within\\\\nour knowledge.  So also are the circumstances connected with the death\\\\nof young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small\\\\ncredit for repentance and confession, since there are still some\\\\ndetails which we can only learn from your lips.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe man groaned and sank his face in his hands.  We waited, but he was\\\\nsilent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I can assure you,\\\" said Holmes, \\\"that every essential is already\\\\nknown.  We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an\\\\nimpress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into\\\\na correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the\\\\nadvertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph.  We are aware that you\\\\nwent down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were\\\\nseen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous\\\\nreason to suspect you.  He saw your theft, but could not give the\\\\nalarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your\\\\nbrother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good\\\\ncitizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at\\\\nyour heels until you reached this very house.  There he intervened, and\\\\nthen it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more\\\\nterrible crime of murder.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I did not!  I did not!  Before God I swear that I did not!\\\" cried our\\\\nwretched prisoner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon\\\\nthe roof of a railway carriage.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I will.  I swear to you that I will.  I did the rest.  I confess it.\\\\nIt was just as you say.  A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid.  I\\\\nneeded the money badly.  Oberstein offered me five thousand.  It was to\\\\nsave myself from ruin.  But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What happened, then?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe.  I\\\\nnever knew it until I was at the very door.  It was thick fog, and one\\\\ncould not see three yards.  I had given two taps and Oberstein had come\\\\nto the door.  The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were\\\\nabout to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver.  He\\\\nalways carried it with him.  As West forced his way after us into the\\\\nhouse Oberstein struck him on the head.  The blow was a fatal one.  He\\\\nwas dead within five minutes.  There he lay in the hall, and we were at\\\\nour wit\\\\'s end what to do.  Then Oberstein had this idea about the\\\\ntrains which halted under his back window.  But first he examined the\\\\npapers which I had brought.  He said that three of them were essential,\\\\nand that he must keep them.  \\\\'You cannot keep them,\\\\' said I.  \\\\'There\\\\nwill be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.\\\\'  \\\\'I must\\\\nkeep them,\\\\' said he, \\\\'for they are so technical that it is impossible\\\\nin the time to make copies.\\\\' \\\\'Then they must all go back together\\\\nto-night,\\\\' said I.  He thought for a little, and then he cried out that\\\\nhe had it. \\\\'Three I will keep,\\\\' said he.  \\\\'The others we will stuff\\\\ninto the pocket of this young man.  When he is found the whole business\\\\nwill assuredly be put to his account.\\\\'  I could see no other way out of\\\\nit, so we did as he suggested.  We waited half an hour at the window\\\\nbefore a train stopped.  It was so thick that nothing could be seen,\\\\nand we had no difficulty in lowering West\\\\'s body on to the train.  That\\\\nwas the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"And your brother?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think\\\\nthat he suspected.  I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know,\\\\nhe never held up his head again.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThere was silence in the room.  It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Can you not make reparation?  It would ease your conscience, and\\\\npossibly your punishment.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"What reparation can I make?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Where is Oberstein with the papers?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I do not know.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Did he give you no address?\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually\\\\nreach him.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Then reparation is still within your power,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"I will do anything I can.  I owe this fellow no particular good-will.\\\\nHe has been my ruin and my downfall.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Here are paper and pen.  Sit at this desk and write to my dictation.\\\\nDirect the envelope to the address given.  That is right.  Now the\\\\nletter:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Dear Sir:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now\\\\nthat one essential detail is missing.  I have a tracing which will make\\\\nit complete.  This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I\\\\nmust ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds.  I will not\\\\ntrust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes.  I\\\\nwould come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the\\\\ncountry at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the\\\\nsmoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday.  Remember\\\\nthat only English notes, or gold, will be taken.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"That will do very well.  I shall be very much surprised if it does not\\\\nfetch our man.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnd it did!  It is a matter of history--that secret history of a nation\\\\nwhich is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public\\\\nchronicles--that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime,\\\\ncame to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British\\\\nprison.  In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans,\\\\nwhich he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.\\\\n\\\\nColonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his\\\\nsentence.  As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon\\\\nthe Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for\\\\nprivate circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon\\\\nthe subject.  Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my\\\\nfriend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably\\\\nfine emerald tie-pin.  When I asked him if he had bought it, he\\\\nanswered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose\\\\ninterests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small\\\\ncommission.  He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that\\\\nlady\\\\'s august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will\\\\nforever recall to my friend\\\\'s memory the adventure of the\\\\nBruce-Partington plans.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n'\",\n          \"b'AFFAIR ***\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration]\\\\n\\\\n                     THE PLYMOUTH EXPRESS AFFAIR\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe little gray cells,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d so often referred to by the great\\\\n    detective Hercule Poirot, certainly get in their fine-work\\\\n    in this intriguing mystery story by an exceptionally\\\\n    talented writer.\\\\n\\\\n                          By Agatha Christie\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlec Simpson, R.

He shoved harder with rising impatience, but it still\\\\nstuck out halfway into the carriage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy the devil wont it go in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered, and hauling it out\\\\ncompletely, he stooped down and peered under the seat....\\\\n\\\\nA moment later a cry rang out into the night, and the great train came\\\\nto an unwilling halt in obedience to the imperative jerking of the\\\\ncommunication-cord.\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMon ami,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Poirot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have, I know, been deeply interested in\\\\nthis mystery of the Plymouth Express. Read this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI picked up the note he flicked across the table to me. It was brief\\\\nand to the point.\\\\n\\\\n    Dear Sir:\\\\n\\\\n    I shall be obliged if you will call upon me at your\\\\n    earliest convenience.\\\\n\\\\n                                Yours faithfully,\\\\n                                      Ebenezer Halliday.\\\\n\\\\nThe connection was not clear to my mind, and I looked inquiringly at\\\\nPoirot. For answer he took up the newspaper and read aloud:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A sensational discovery was made last night. A young naval officer\\\\nreturning to Plymouth found under the seat of his compartment, the\\\\nbody of a woman, stabbed through the heart. The officer at once pulled\\\\nthe communication-cord, and the train was brought to a standstill. The\\\\nwoman who was about thirty years of age, and richly dressed, has not\\\\nyet been identified.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd later we have this: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The woman found dead in the Plymouth Express\\\\nhas been identified as the Honorable Mrs. Rupert Carrington.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 You see\\\\nnow, my friend? Or if you do not, I will add this. Mrs. Rupert\\\\nCarrington was, before her marriage, Flossie Halliday, daughter of old\\\\nman Halliday, the steel king of America.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd he has sent for you? Splendid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did him a little service in the past\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94an affair of bearer bonds. And\\\\nonce, when I was in Paris for a royal visit, I had Mademoiselle\\\\nFlossie pointed out to me. _La jolie petite pensionnaire!_ She had the\\\\n_jolie dot_ too! It caused trouble. She nearly made a bad affair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA certain Count de la Rochefour. _Un bien mauvais sujet!_ A bad hat,\\\\nas you would say. An adventurer pure and simple, who knew how to\\\\nappeal to a romantic young girl. Luckily her father got wind of it in\\\\ntime. He took her back to America in haste. I heard of her marriage\\\\nsome years later, but I know nothing of her husband.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Honorable Rupert Carrington is no beauty, by all\\\\naccounts. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d pretty well run through his own money on the turf, and\\\\nI should imagine old man Halliday\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dollars came along in the nick of\\\\ntime. I should say that for a good-looking, well-mannered, utterly\\\\nunscrupulous young scoundrel, it would be hard to find his match!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, the poor little lady! _Elle n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99est pas bien tomb\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e!_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy he made it pretty obvious at once that it was her money, and\\\\nnot she, that had attracted him. I believe they drifted apart almost\\\\nat once. I have heard rumors lately that there was to be a definite\\\\nlegal separation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOld man Halliday is no fool. He would tie up her money pretty tight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dare say. Anyway, I know as a fact that the Honorable Rupert is\\\\nsaid to be extremely hard up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh-ha! I wonder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou wonder what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy good friend, do not jump down my throat like that. You are\\\\ninterested, I see. Supposing you accompany me to see Mr. Halliday.\\\\nThere is a taxi stand at the corner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nA very few minutes sufficed to whirl us to the superb house in Park\\\\nLane rented by the American magnate. We were shown into the library,\\\\nand almost immediately we were joined by a large, stout man, with\\\\npiercing eyes and an aggressive chin.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cM. Poirot?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Halliday. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI guess I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need to tell you what\\\\nI want you for. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read the papers, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m never one to let the\\\\ngrass grow under my feet. I happened to hear you were in London, and I\\\\nremembered the good work you did over those bonds. Never forget a\\\\nname. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the pick of Scotland Yard, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have my own man as\\\\nwell. Money no object. All the dollars were made for my little\\\\ngirl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and now she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll spend my last cent to catch the damned\\\\nscoundrel that did it! See? So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up to you to deliver the goods.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot bowed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI accept, monsieur, all the more willingly that I saw your daughter\\\\nin Paris several times. And now I will ask you to tell me the\\\\ncircumstances of her journey to Plymouth and any other details that\\\\nseem to you to bear upon the case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to begin with,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d responded Halliday, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to\\\\nPlymouth. She was going to join a house-party at Avonmead Court, the\\\\nDuchess of Swansea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place. She left London by the twelve-fourteen\\\\nfrom Paddington, arriving at Bristol (where she had to change) at\\\\ntwo-fifty. The principal Plymouth expresses, of course, run via\\\\nWestbury, and do not go near Bristol at all. The twelve-fourteen does\\\\na nonstop run to Bristol, afterward stopping at Weston, Taunton,\\\\nExeter and Newton Abbot. My daughter traveled alone in her carriage,\\\\nwhich was reserved as far as Bristol, her maid being in a third-class\\\\ncarriage in the next coach.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nPoirot nodded, and Mr. Halliday went on: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe party at Avonmead Court\\\\nwas to be a very gay one, with several balls, and in consequence my\\\\ndaughter had with her nearly all her jewels\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94amounting in value\\\\nperhaps, to about a hundred thousand dollars.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Un moment_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d interrupted Poirot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho had charge of the jewels? Your\\\\ndaughter, or the maid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy daughter always took charge of them herself, carrying them in a\\\\nsmall blue morocco case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cContinue, monsieur.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt Bristol the maid, Jane Mason, collected her mistress\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dressing-bag\\\\nand wraps, which were with her, and came to the door of Flossie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ncompartment. To her intense surprise, my daughter told her that she\\\\nwas not getting out at Bristol, but was going on farther. She directed\\\\nMason to get out the luggage and put it in the cloak-room. She could\\\\nhave tea in the refreshment-room, but she was to wait at the station\\\\nfor her mistress, who would return to Bristol by an up-train in the\\\\ncourse of the afternoon. The maid, although very much astonished, did\\\\nas she was told. She put the luggage in the cloak-room and had some\\\\ntea. But up-train after up-train came in, and her mistress did not\\\\nappear. After the arrival of the last train, she left the luggage\\\\nwhere it was, and went to a hotel near the station for the night. This\\\\nmorning she read of the tragedy, and returned to town by the first\\\\navailable train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs there nothing to account for your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden change of\\\\nplan?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there is this: According to Jane Mason, at Bristol, Flossie was\\\\nno longer alone in her carriage. There was a man in it who stood\\\\nlooking out of the farther window so that she could not see his face.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe train was a corridor one, of course?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich side was the corridor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the platform side. My daughter was standing in the corridor as she\\\\ntalked to Mason.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd there is no doubt in your mind\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94excuse me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He got up, and\\\\ncarefully straightened the inkstand which was a little askew. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Je\\\\nvous demande pardon_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, reseating himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt affects my\\\\nnerves to see anything crooked. Strange, is it not? I was saying,\\\\nmonsieur, that there is no doubt in your mind, as to this probably\\\\nunexpected meeting being the cause of your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden change of\\\\nplan?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems the only reasonable supposition.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have no idea as to who the gentleman in question might be?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe millionaire hesitated for a moment, and then replied.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I do not know at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94as to the discovery of the body?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was discovered by a young naval officer who at once gave the\\\\nalarm. There was a doctor on the train. He examined the body. She had\\\\nbeen first chloroformed, and then stabbed. He gave it as his opinion\\\\nthat she had been dead about four hours, so it must have been done not\\\\nlong after leaving Bristol. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Probably between there and Weston,\\\\npossibly between Weston and Taunton.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the jewel-case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe jewel-case, M. Poirot, was missing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne thing more, monsieur. Your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fortune\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94to whom does it\\\\npass at her death?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlossie made a will soon after her marriage, leaving everything to\\\\nher husband.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He hesitated for a minute, and then went on: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI may as\\\\nwell tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that I regard my son-in-law as an\\\\nunprincipled scoundrel, and that, by my advice, my daughter was on the\\\\neve of freeing herself from him by legal means\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94no difficult matter. I\\\\nsettled her money upon her in such a way that he could not touch it\\\\nduring her lifetime, but although they have lived entirely apart for\\\\nsome years, she has frequently acceded to his demands for money,\\\\nrather than face an open scandal. However, I was determined to put an\\\\nend to this, and at last Flossie agreed, and my lawyers were\\\\ninstructed to take proceedings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd where is Monsieur Carrington?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn town. I believe he was away in the country yesterday, but he\\\\nreturned last night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot considered a little while. Then he said: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that is all,\\\\nmonsieur.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou would like to see the maid, Jane Mason?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nHalliday rang the bell, and gave a short order to the footman. A few\\\\nminutes later Jane Mason entered the room, a respectable,\\\\nhard-featured woman, as emotionless in the face of tragedy as only a\\\\ngood servant can be.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will permit me to put a few questions? Your mistress, she was\\\\nquite as usual before starting yesterday morning? Not excited or\\\\nflurried?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut at Bristol she was quite different?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes sir, regular upset\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94so nervous she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to know what she\\\\nwas saying.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did she say exactly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell sir, as near as I can remember, she said: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mason, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to\\\\nalter my plans. Something has happened\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I mean, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not getting out\\\\nhere after all. I must go on. Get out the luggage and put it in the\\\\ncloak-room; then have some tea, and wait for me in the station.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Wait for you here, ma\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99am?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, yes. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave the station. I shall return by a later train.\\\\nI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know when. It mayn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be until quite late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very well, ma\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99am,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I says. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t my place to ask questions, but\\\\nI thought it very strange.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was unlike your mistress, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery unlike her, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you think?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell sir, I thought it was to do with the gentleman in the carriage.\\\\nShe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to him, but she turned round once or twice as though\\\\nto ask him if she was doing right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo sir; he stood with his back to me all the time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you describe him at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe had on a light fawn overcoat, and a traveling cap. He was tall and\\\\nslender, like, and the back of his head was dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was not your master, Mr. Carrington, by any chance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMason looked rather startled.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh! I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you are not _sure_?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was about the master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s build, sir\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but I never thought of it being\\\\nhim. We so seldom saw him. I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say it _wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t_ him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot picked up a pin from the carpet, and frowned at it severely;\\\\nthen he continued: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould it be possible for the man to have entered\\\\nthe train at Bristol before you reached the carriage?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMason considered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes sir, I think it would. My compartment was very crowded, and it\\\\nwas some minutes before I could get out\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and then there was a very\\\\nlarge crowd on the platform, and that delayed me too. But he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d only\\\\nhave had a minute or two to speak to the mistress, that way. I took it\\\\nfor granted that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d come along the corridor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is more probable, certainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe paused, still frowning.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know how the mistress was dressed, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe papers give a few details, but I would like you to confirm them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was wearing a white fox fur toque, sir, with a white spotted\\\\nveil, and a blue frieze coat and skirt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the shade of blue they call\\\\nelectric.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m, rather striking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Halliday. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cInspector Japp is in hopes that that may\\\\nhelp us to fix the spot where the crime took place. Anyone who saw her\\\\nwould remember her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Pr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9cis\\\\xc3\\\\xa9ment!_ \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Thank you, mademoiselle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The maid left the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot got up briskly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is all I can do here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94except,\\\\nmonsieur, that I would ask you to tell me everything\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but\\\\n_everything_!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have done so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen there is nothing more to be said. I must decline the case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause you have not been frank with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assure you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, you are keeping something back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nThere was a moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pause, and then Halliday drew a paper from his\\\\npocket and handed it to my friend.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI guess that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re after, Monsieur Poirot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94though how you know\\\\nabout it fairly gets my goat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot smiled, and unfolded the paper. It was a letter written in thin\\\\nsloping handwriting. Poirot read it aloud.\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ch\\\\xc3\\\\xa8re Madame:\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is with infinite pleasure that I look forward to the\\\\n    felicity of meeting you again. After your so amiable reply to\\\\n    my letter, I can hardly restrain my impatience. I have never\\\\n    forgotten those days in Paris. It is most cruel that you\\\\n    should be leaving London tomorrow. However, before very long,\\\\n    and perhaps sooner than you think, I shall have the joy of\\\\n    beholding once more the lady whose image has ever reigned\\\\n    supreme in my heart.\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Believe, ch\\\\xc3\\\\xa8re madame, all the assurances of my most devoted\\\\n    and unaltered sentiments\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\n                                        \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Armand de la Rochefour.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot handed the letter back to Halliday with a bow.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy, monsieur, that you did not know that your daughter intended\\\\nrenewing her acquaintance with the Count de la Rochefour?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt came as a thunderbolt to me! I found this letter in my daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhandbag. As you probably know, Monsieur Poirot, this so-called count\\\\nis an adventurer of the worst type.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot nodded.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what I want to know is how you knew of the existence of this\\\\nletter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMy friend smiled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMonsieur, I did not. But to track footmarks, and\\\\nrecognize cigarette-ash is not sufficient for a detective. He must\\\\nalso be a good psychologist! I knew that you disliked and mistrusted\\\\nyour son-in-law. He benefits by your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death; the maid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ndescription of the mysterious man bears a sufficient resemblance to\\\\nhim. Yet you are not keen on his track! Why? Surely because your\\\\nsuspicions lie in another direction. Therefore you were keeping\\\\nsomething back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right, Monsieur Poirot. I was sure of Rupert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guilt until I\\\\nfound this letter. It unsettled me horribly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. The Count says: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Before very long, and perhaps sooner than you\\\\nthink.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Obviously he would not want to wait until you should get wind\\\\nof his reappearance. Was it he who traveled down from London by the\\\\ntwelve-fourteen, and came along the corridor to your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ncompartment? The Count de la Rochefour is also, if I remember rightly,\\\\ntall and dark!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe millionaire nodded.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, monsieur, I will wish you good day. Scotland Yard, has, I\\\\npresume, a list of the jewels?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I believe Inspector Japp is here now if you would like to see\\\\nhim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nJapp was an old friend of ours, and greeted Poirot with a sort of\\\\naffectionate contempt.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how are you, monsieur? No bad feeling between us, though we\\\\n_have_ got our different ways of looking at things. How are the\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98little gray cells,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 eh? Going strong?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot beamed upon him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey function, my good Japp; assuredly they\\\\ndo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right. Think it was the Honorable Rupert, or a crook?\\\\nWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keeping an eye on all the regular places, of course. We shall\\\\nknow if the shiners are disposed of, and of course whoever did it\\\\nisn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to keep them to admire their sparkle. Not likely! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\ntrying to find out where Rupert Carrington was yesterday. Seems a bit\\\\nof a mystery about it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a man watching him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA great precaution, but perhaps a day late,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d suggested Poirot gently.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou always will have your joke, Monsieur Poirot. Well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m off to\\\\nPaddington. Bristol, Weston, Taunton, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s my beat. So long.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will come round and see me this evening, and tell me the result?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSure thing, if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat good Inspector believes in matter in motion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Poirot as\\\\nour friend departed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe travels; he measures footprints; he collects\\\\nmud and cigarette-ash! He is extremely busy! He is zealous beyond\\\\nwords! And if I mentioned psychology to him, do you know what he would\\\\ndo, my friend? He would smile! He would say to himself: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Poor old\\\\nPoirot! He ages! He grows senile!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Japp is the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98younger generation\\\\nknocking on the door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 And _ma foi!_ They are so busy knocking that\\\\nthey do not notice that the door is open!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what are you going to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs we have _carte blanche_, I shall expend threepence in ringing up\\\\nthe Ritz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94where you may have noticed our Count is staying. After that,\\\\nas my feet are a little damp, and I have sneezed twice, I shall return\\\\nto my rooms and make myself a _tisano_ over the spirit lamp!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nI did not see Poirot again until the following morning. I found him\\\\nplacidly finishing his breakfast.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I inquired eagerly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat has happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Japp?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have not seen him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Count?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe left the Ritz the day before yesterday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe day of the murder?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that settles it! Rupert Carrington is cleared.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause the Count de la Rochefour has left the Ritz? You go too fast,\\\\nmy friend.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, he must be followed, arrested! But what could be his motive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne hundred thousand dollars\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worth of jewelry is a very good motive\\\\nfor anyone. No, the question to my mind is: why kill her? Why not\\\\nsimply steal the jewels? She would not prosecute.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause she is a woman, _mon ami_. She once loved this man. Therefore\\\\nshe would suffer her loss in silence. And the Count, who is an\\\\nextremely good psychologist where women are concerned,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94hence his\\\\nsuccesses,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94would know that perfectly well! On the other hand, if\\\\nRupert Carrington killed her, why take the jewels, which would\\\\nincriminate him fatally?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs a blind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps you are right, my friend. Ah, here is Japp! I recognize his\\\\nknock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe Inspector was beaming good-humoredly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMorning, Poirot. Only just got back. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done some good work! And\\\\nyou?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe, I have arranged my ideas,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied Poirot placidly.\\\\n\\\\nJapp laughed heartily.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOld chap\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s getting on in years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he observed beneath his breath to\\\\nme. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat wont do for us young folk,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said aloud.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Quel dommage?_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot inquired.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, do you want to hear what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou permit me to make a guess? You have found the knife with which\\\\nthe crime was committed by the side of the line between Weston and\\\\nTaunton, and you have interviewed the paper-boy who spoke to Mrs.\\\\nCarrington at Weston!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nJapp\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaw fell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow on earth did you know? Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me it was\\\\nthose almighty \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98little gray cells\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of yours!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad you admit for once that they are _all mighty_! Tell me, did\\\\nshe give the paper-boy a shilling for himself?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it was half a crown!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Japp recovered his temper and grinned.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPretty extravagant, these rich Americans!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd in consequence the boy did not forget her?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot he. Half-crowns don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come his way every day. She hailed him and\\\\nbought two magazines. One had a picture of a girl in blue on the\\\\ncover. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll match me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she said. Oh! he remembered her perfectly.\\\\nWell, that was enough for me. By the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s evidence, the crime\\\\n_must_ have been committed before Taunton. I guessed they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d throw the\\\\nknife away at once, and I walked down the line looking for it; and\\\\nsure enough, there it was. I made inquiries at Taunton about our man,\\\\nbut of course it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a big station, and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t likely they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d notice\\\\nhim. He probably got back to London by a later train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot nodded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery likely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I found another bit of news when I got back. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re passing the\\\\njewels, all right! That large emerald was pawned last night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94by one of\\\\nthe regular lot. Who do you think it was?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94except that he was a short man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nJapp stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right there. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s short enough. It was Red\\\\nNarky.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho on earth is Red Narky?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA particularly sharp jewel-thief, sir. And not one to stick at\\\\nmurder. Usually works with a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Gracie Kidd; but she doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem\\\\nto be in it this time\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94unless she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got off to Holland with the rest of\\\\nthe swag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve arrested Narky?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSure thing. But mind you, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the other man we want\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the man who went\\\\ndown with Mrs. Carrington in the train. He was the one who planned the\\\\njob, right enough. But Narky wont squeal on a pal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI noticed that Poirot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes had become very green.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said gently, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I can find Narky\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pal for you, all\\\\nright.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of your little ideas, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Japp eyed Poirot sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonderful\\\\nhow you manage to deliver the goods sometimes, at your age and all.\\\\nDevil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own luck, of course.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps, perhaps,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured my friend. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHastings, my hat. And the\\\\nbrush. So! My galoshes if it still rains! We must not undo the good\\\\nwork of that _tisano_. Au revoir, Japp!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck to you, Poirot.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nPoirot hailed the first taxi we met, and directed the driver to Park\\\\nLane.\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nWhen we drew up before Halliday\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house, he skipped out nimbly, paid\\\\nthe driver and rang the bell. To the footman who opened the door he\\\\nmade a request in a low voice, and we were immediately taken upstairs.\\\\nWe went up to the top of the house, and were shown into a small neat\\\\nbedroom.\\\\n\\\\nPoirot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes roved round the room and fastened themselves on a small\\\\nblack trunk. He knelt in front of it, scrutinized the labels on it,\\\\nand took a small twist of wire from his pocket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAsk Mr. Halliday if he will be so kind as to mount to me here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nsaid over his shoulder to the footman.\\\\n\\\\n(It is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story at\\\\nthis point, make his own solution of the mystery\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and then see how\\\\nclose he comes to that of the author.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94The Editors.)\\\\n\\\\nThe man departed, and Poirot gently coaxed the lock of the trunk with\\\\na practiced hand. In a few minutes the lock gave, and he raised the\\\\nlid of the trunk. Swiftly he began rummaging among the clothes it\\\\ncontained, flinging them out on the floor.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a heavy step on the stairs, and Halliday entered the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat in hell are you doing here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he demanded, staring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was looking, monsieur, for _this_.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot withdrew from the trunk\\\\na coat and skirt of bright blue frieze, and a small toque of white fox\\\\nfur.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing with my trunk?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I turned to see that the maid,\\\\nJane Mason, had just entered the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you will just shut the door, Hastings. Thank you. Yes, and stand\\\\nwith your back against it. Now, Mr. Halliday, let me introduce you to\\\\nGrace Kidd, otherwise Jane Mason, who will shortly rejoin her\\\\naccomplice, Red Narky, under the kind escort of Japp.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was of the most simple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot waved a deprecating hand, then\\\\nhelped himself to more caviare. It is not every day that one lunches\\\\nwith a millionaire.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was the maid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s insistence on the clothes that her mistress was\\\\nwearing that first struck me. Why was she so anxious that our\\\\nattention should be directed to them? I reflected that we had only the\\\\nmaid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s word for the mysterious man in the carriage at Bristol. As far\\\\nas the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s evidence went, Mrs. Carrington might easily have been\\\\nmurdered _before_ reaching Bristol. But if so, then the maid must be\\\\nan accomplice. And if she were an accomplice, she would not wish this\\\\npoint to rest on her evidence alone. The clothes Mrs. Carrington was\\\\nwearing were of a striking nature. A maid usually has a good deal of\\\\nchoice as to what her mistress shall wear. Now if, after Bristol,\\\\nanyone saw a lady in a bright blue coat and skirt, and a fur toque, he\\\\nwill be quite ready to swear he has seen Mrs. Carrington.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI began to reconstruct. The maid would provide herself with duplicate\\\\nclothes. She and her accomplice chloroform and stab Mrs. Carrington\\\\nbetween London and Bristol, probably taking advantage of a tunnel. Her\\\\nbody is rolled under the seat; the maid takes her place. At Weston she\\\\nmust make herself noticed. How? In all probability, a newspaper-boy\\\\nwill be selected. She will insure his remembering her by giving him a\\\\nlarge tip. She also drew his attention to the color of her dress by a\\\\nremark about one of the magazines. After leaving Weston, she throws\\\\nthe knife out of the window to mark the place where the crime\\\\npresumably occurred, and changes her clothes, or buttons a long\\\\nmackintosh over them. At Taunton she leaves the train and returns to\\\\nBristol as soon as possible, where her accomplice has duly left the\\\\nluggage in the cloak-room. He hands over the ticket and himself\\\\nreturns to London. She waits on the platform, carrying out her r\\\\xc3\\\\xb4le,\\\\ngoes to a hotel for the night and returns to town in the morning\\\\nexactly as she said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Japp returned from his expedition, he confirmed all my\\\\ndeductions. He also told me that a well-known crook was passing the\\\\njewels. I knew that whoever it was would be the exact opposite of the\\\\nman Jane Mason described. When I heard that it was Red Narky, who\\\\nalways worked with Gracie Kidd\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94well, I knew just where to find her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the Count?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe more I thought of it, the more I was convinced that he had\\\\nnothing to do with it. That gentleman is much too careful of his own\\\\nskin to risk murder.

I have seldom heard\\\\nhim mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He\\\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\\\nthe world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a\\\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94excellent\\\\nfor drawing the veil from men\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motives and actions. But for the\\\\ntrained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and\\\\nfinely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which\\\\nmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\\\n\\\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention;\\\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole\\\\nBohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among\\\\nhis old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and\\\\nambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his\\\\nown keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study\\\\nof crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers\\\\nof observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\\\nmysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing\\\\nup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,\\\\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\\\n\\\\nOne night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it was on the 20th of March, 1888\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I was returning from a\\\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\\\nstory. He was at work again. He had arisen out of his drug-created\\\\ndreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\\\\nbell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part\\\\nmy own.\\\\n\\\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\\\nme to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the\\\\nfire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWedlock suits you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Watson, that you have put\\\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeven!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\\\nthat you intended to go into harness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, how do you know?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\\\nservant girl?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is too much. You would certainly have\\\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had\\\\na country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I\\\\nhave changed my clothes, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there,\\\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is simplicity itself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy eyes tell me that on the\\\\ninside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the\\\\nleather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have\\\\nbeen caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the\\\\nedges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you\\\\nsee, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and\\\\nthat you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\\\\nLondon slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms\\\\nsmelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his\\\\nright forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where\\\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\\\nprocess of deduction. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\\\nreasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I\\\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\\\ndown into an arm-chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, but you do not observe. The\\\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrequently.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow often?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, some hundreds of times.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen how many are there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow many? I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\\\nboth seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these\\\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He threw\\\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open\\\\nupon the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt came by the last post,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRead it aloud.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nit said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the\\\\nvery deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses\\\\nof Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\\\nwear a mask.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is indeed a mystery,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you imagine that it\\\\nmeans?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has\\\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\\\nit?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\\\nwritten.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked,\\\\nendeavoring to imitate my companion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s processes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSuch paper could not\\\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\\\nstiff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeculiar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is the very word,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is not an English\\\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI did so, and saw a large _E_ with a small _g_, a _P_, and a large _G_\\\\nwith a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you make of that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. The _G_ with the small _t_ stands for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Gesellschaft,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nwhich is the German for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Company.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 It is a customary contraction like\\\\nour \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Co.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 _P_, of course, stands for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Papier.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Now for the _Eg_. Let us\\\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took down a heavy brown volume\\\\nfrom his shelves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEglow, Eglonitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94here we are, Egria. It is in a\\\\nGerman-speaking country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Remarkable\\\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\\\nthat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\\\nfrom his cigarette.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\\\npeculiar construction of the sentence\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This account of you we have\\\\nfrom all quarters received.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 A Frenchman or Russian could not have\\\\nwritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It\\\\nonly remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German\\\\nwho writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing\\\\nhis face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\\\ndoubts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 hoofs and grating\\\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\\\\nwhistled.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA pair, by the sound,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, glancing out of\\\\nthe window. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\\\\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s money in this case, Watson, if there\\\\nis nothing else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\\\\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut your client\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\\\\nSit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\\\nauthoritative tap.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome in!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA MAN ENTERED\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\\\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\\\ntaste. Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which\\\\nwas thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and\\\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\\\nberyl. Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were\\\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\\\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\\\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging\\\\nlip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the\\\\nlength of obstinacy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had my note?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\\\nmarked German accent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI told you that I would call.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked from\\\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take a seat,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\\\nhave I the honor to address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\\\\nI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor\\\\nand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\\\nmy chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is both, or none,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may say before this\\\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe count shrugged his broad shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I must begin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of\\\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\\\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\\\nEuropean history.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI promise,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse this mask,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued our strange visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe august\\\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\\\nnot exactly my own.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was aware of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, dryly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has\\\\nto be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\\\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\\\nkings of Bohemia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was also aware of that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\\\nhis arm-chair and closing his eyes.\\\\n\\\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as\\\\nthe most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nshould be better able to advise you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nhe cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, indeed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour Majesty had not spoken before\\\\nI was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\\\nBohemia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you can understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\\\nmore and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou can\\\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\\\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\\\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, pray consult,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\\\\nadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKindly look her up in my index, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes, without\\\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult\\\\nto name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\\\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\\\nthat of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me see!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year\\\\n1858. Contralto\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\\\\nWarsaw\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Yes! Retired from operatic stage\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ha! Living in London\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94quite\\\\nso! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young\\\\nperson, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\\\ngetting those letters back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so. But how\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas there a secret marriage?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo legal papers or certificates?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\\\nprove their authenticity?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is the writing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy private note-paper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStolen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy own seal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cImitated.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBought.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe were both in the photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\\\nindiscretion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was mad\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94insane.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must be recovered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have tried and failed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe will not sell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStolen, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\\\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo sign of it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut a very serious one to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d returned the King, reproachfully.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo ruin me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am about to be married.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I have heard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\\\nwould bring the matter to an end.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd Irene Adler?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\\\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are\\\\nno lengths to which she would not go\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, then, we have three days yet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, with a yawn. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is\\\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\\\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\\\npresent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the\\\\nCount Von Kramm.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, as to money?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have _carte blanche_.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\\\nhave that photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd for present expenses?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\\\nit on the table.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nsaid.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\\\nto him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd mademoiselle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wood.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes took a note of it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne other question,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas the\\\\nphotograph a cabinet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\\\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added, as the\\\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you will be\\\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, I should\\\\nlike to chat this little matter over with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nII\\\\n\\\\nAt three o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\\\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\\\nshortly after eight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\\\\nfire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he\\\\nmight be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though\\\\nit was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which\\\\nwere associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,\\\\nstill, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client\\\\ngave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\\\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\\\n\\\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to\\\\nmy friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look\\\\nthree times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod\\\\nhe vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed\\\\nheartily for some minutes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, really!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until\\\\nhe was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\\\\nI left the house a little after eight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock this morning, in the\\\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\\\\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\\\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\\\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\\\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it\\\\nand examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\\\nanything else of interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there\\\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\\\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in\\\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom I was\\\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\\\nlisten to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what of Irene Adler?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, she has turned all the men\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heads down in that part. She\\\\nis the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\\\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\\\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\\\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all that they had to\\\\ntell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to\\\\nthink over my plan of campaign.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the\\\\nmatter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation\\\\nbetween them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she\\\\nhis client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had\\\\nprobably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,\\\\nit was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I\\\\nshould continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\\\ngentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\\\nto understand the situation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am following you closely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove\\\\nup to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94evidently the man of whom\\\\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\\\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up\\\\nto the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\\\nearnestly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Drive like the devil,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98first to Gross &\\\\nHankey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Regent Street, and then to the church of St. Monica in the\\\\nEdgware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\\\\nwell to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the\\\\ncoachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,\\\\nwhile all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I\\\\nonly caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman,\\\\nwith a face that a man might die for.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Church of St. Monica, John,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and half a sovereign if\\\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau,\\\\nwhen a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a\\\\nshabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Church of\\\\nSt. Monica,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\\\nminutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy cabby drove fast. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do. Come! Come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be legal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I\\\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting\\\\nin the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of\\\\nit that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been\\\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely\\\\nrefused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\\\nmean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand what then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\\\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she said, as she left\\\\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\\\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich are?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, ringing the bell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\\\nthis evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall be delighted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind breaking the law?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot in the least.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNor running a chance of arrest?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot in a good cause.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, the cause is excellent!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I am your man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was sure that I might rely on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what is it you wish?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\\\\nyou. Now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\\\nlandlady had provided, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\\\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\\\\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\\\\ncome what may. You understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am to be neutral?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\\\\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\\\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd when I raise my hand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94so\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you will throw into the room what I give\\\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\\\\nquite follow me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEntirely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is nothing very formidable,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\\\nroll from his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is an ordinary plumber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smoke-rocket,\\\\nfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\\\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken\\\\nup by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\\\\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\\\nmyself clear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at\\\\nthe signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you may entirely rely on me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\\\nfor the new role I have to play.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the\\\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\\\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\\\\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\\\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\\\nspecialist in crime.\\\\n\\\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\\\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\\\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\\\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\\\nSherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s succinct description, but the locality appeared to\\\\nbe less private that I expected. On the contrary, for a small street\\\\nin a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a\\\\ngroup of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\\\nhouse, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\\\\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\\\\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\\\\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\\\\nthe photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere, indeed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dress. She knows\\\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\\\\nshe does not carry it about with her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\\\nlike to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to any one\\\\nelse? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell\\\\nwhat indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\\\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\\\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\\\\nin her own house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it has twice been burgled.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how will you look?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will not look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will get her to show me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut she will refuse.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the\\\\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\\\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\\\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her\\\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\\\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\\\\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is dead,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried several voices.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life in him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted another. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be gone\\\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a brave fellow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a woman. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey would have had the lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\npurse and watch if it hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\\\nrough one, too. Ah, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s breathing now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\\\nThis way, please!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post\\\\nby the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been\\\\ndrawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not\\\\nknow whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part\\\\nhe was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\\\\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom\\\\nI was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\\\\nupon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to\\\\nHolmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.\\\\nI hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.\\\\nAfter all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing\\\\nher from injuring another.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\\\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\\\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed\\\\nmy rocket into the room with a cry of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFire!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The word was no sooner\\\\nout of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\\\nill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94joined in a general shriek\\\\nof \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFire!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at\\\\nthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment\\\\nlater the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\\\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm\\\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\\\\nand in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of\\\\nthe quiet streets which lead towards the Edgware Road.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did it very nicely, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing could have been\\\\nbetter. It is all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have the photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know where it is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how did you find out?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe showed me, as I told you that she would.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am still in the dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not wish to make a mystery,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe matter was\\\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that every one in the street was\\\\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI guessed as much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\\\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat also I could fathom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined\\\\nto see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\\\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did that help you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\\\nshe half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\\\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\\\\na satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd when will you call?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\\\\ndelay.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was\\\\nsearching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard that voice before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, staring down the dimly-lit\\\\nstreet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIII\\\\n\\\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\\\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have really got it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\\\\nshoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you have hopes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have hopes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must have a cab.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, my brougham is waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that will simplify matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d We descended, and started off once\\\\nmore for Briony Lodge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIrene Adler is married,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMarried! When?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYesterday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut to whom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut she could not love him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am in hopes that she does.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why in hopes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\\\\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\\\nyour Majesty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plan.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is true. And yet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What\\\\na queen she would have made!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He relapsed into a moody silence, which\\\\nwas not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\\\n\\\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon\\\\nthe steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\\\nbrougham.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered my companion, looking at her with a\\\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for\\\\nthe Continent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\\\nsurprise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you mean that she has left England?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever to return.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the papers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked the King, hoarsely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll is lost.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter,\\\\nand, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\\\\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\\\nsuperscribed to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d My\\\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\\\nmidnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94You really did it very\\\\n  well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of\\\\n  fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had\\\\n  betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against\\\\n  you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an\\\\n  agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been\\\\n  given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you\\\\n  wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard\\\\n  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you\\\\n  know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume\\\\n  is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom\\\\n  which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran\\\\n  up-stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and\\\\n  came down just as you departed.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\\\n  really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock\\\\n  Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\\\\n  started for the Temple to see my husband.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\\\n  so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty\\\\n  when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may\\\\n  rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he.\\\\n  The King may do what he will without hinderance from one whom\\\\n  he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself,\\\\n  and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any\\\\n  steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph\\\\n  which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock\\\\n  Holmes, very truly yours,      IRENE NORTON, _n\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e_ ADLER.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94oh, what a woman!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the King of Bohemia, when we\\\\nhad all three read this epistle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid I not tell you how quick and\\\\nresolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not\\\\na pity that she was not on my level?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, coldly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sorry\\\\nthat I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business to a more\\\\nsuccessful conclusion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the King; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnothing could be more\\\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\\\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\\\nyou. This ring\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have but to name it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis photograph!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIrene\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s photograph!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, if you wish it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\\\nI have the honor to wish you a very good-morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He bowed, and,\\\\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\\\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by\\\\na woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but\\\\nI have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler,\\\\nor when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable\\\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure II\\\\n\\\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn\\\\nof last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout,\\\\nflorid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology\\\\nfor my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me\\\\nabruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nsaid, cordially.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was afraid that you were engaged.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I am. Very much so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I can wait in the next room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\\\\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\\\ngreeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small,\\\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTry the settee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting\\\\nhis finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\\\\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. You have\\\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\\\\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\\\\nso many of my own little adventures.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\nobserved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to\\\\nlife itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\\\nimagination.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,\\\\nfor otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your\\\\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.\\\\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\\\\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\\\\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that\\\\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\\\\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\\\\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\\\nAs far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the\\\\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\\\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\\\\nyour narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has\\\\nnot heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the\\\\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\\\\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\\\\ncases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\\\nlittle pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\\\\npocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,\\\\nwith his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his\\\\nknee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion\\\\nof my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by\\\\nhis dress or appearance.\\\\n\\\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\\\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\\\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s check trousers,\\\\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\\\\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\\\\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\\\\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\\\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\\\\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his\\\\nhead with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBeyond the\\\\nobvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes\\\\nsnuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he\\\\nhas done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing\\\\nelse.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\\\\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nhe asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labor. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nas true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s carpenter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\\\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\\\nrest it upon the desk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, but China?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\\\ncould only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo\\\\nmarks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.\\\\nThat trick of staining the fishes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 scales of a delicate pink is quite\\\\npeculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\\\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I never!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought\\\\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\\\\nnothing in it, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI begin to think, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I make a mistake in\\\\nexplaining. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you know, and my poor little\\\\nreputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can\\\\nyou not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I have got it now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, with his thick, red finger\\\\nplanted half-way down the column. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere it is. This is what began it\\\\nall. You just read it for yourself, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI took the paper from him, and read as follows:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the\\\\n  late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now\\\\n  another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League\\\\n  to a salary of \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a week for purely nominal services. All\\\\n  red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above\\\\n  the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on\\\\n  Monday, at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of\\\\n  the League, 7 Pope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Court, Fleet Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth does this mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated, after I had twice read\\\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\\\nhigh spirits. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nhe. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about\\\\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper\\\\nand the date.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have a small pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the city. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a very large affair,\\\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I\\\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\\\\nwould have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half\\\\nwages, so as to learn the business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Sherlock Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not such a youth, either. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;\\\\nand I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what\\\\nI am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\\\\nput ideas in his head?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employ\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_ who\\\\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\\\nemployers in this age. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that your assistant is not as\\\\nremarkable as your advertisement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, he has his faults, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Wilson. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever was such a fellow\\\\nfor photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\\\\ninto its hole to develope his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on\\\\nthe whole, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a good worker. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no vice in him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is still with you, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking,\\\\nand keeps the place clean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all I have in the house, for I am a\\\\nwidower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three\\\\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do\\\\nnothing more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\\\\npaper in his hand, and he says:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another vacancy on the League of the\\\\nRed-headed Men. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\\\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\\\\nso that the trustees are at their wits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end what to do with the money.\\\\nIf my hair would only change color, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a nice little crib all ready\\\\nfor me to step into.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, what is it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\\\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having\\\\nto go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know much of what was going on outside,\\\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked,\\\\nwith his eyes open.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Never.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\\\nvacancies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And what are they worth?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\\\\nneed not interfere very much with one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other occupations.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\\\nbusiness has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of\\\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell me all about it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, showing me the advertisement, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you can see for\\\\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\\\\nwhere you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\\\nLeague was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who\\\\nwas very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a\\\\ngreat sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found\\\\nthat he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\\\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\\\nmen whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay,\\\\nand very little to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\\\napply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Not so many as you might think,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You see it is really\\\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from\\\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\\\\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;\\\\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\\\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if\\\\nthere was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance\\\\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\\\\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\\\\nhim to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.\\\\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and\\\\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\\\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\\\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Court looked\\\\nlike a coster\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were\\\\nso many in the whole country as were brought together by that single\\\\nadvertisement. Every shade of color they were\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94straw, lemon, orange,\\\\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\\\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many\\\\nwere waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would\\\\nnot hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and\\\\npulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to\\\\nthe steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the\\\\nstair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\\\\nwedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, as\\\\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray continue your very interesting statement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\\\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even\\\\nredder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came\\\\nup, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\\\ndisqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\\\\nmatter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much\\\\nmore favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\\\\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said my assistant, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and he is willing to\\\\nfill a vacancy in the League.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And he is admirably suited for it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the other answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98He has every\\\\nrequirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He\\\\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\\\\nuntil I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\\\\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It would be injustice to hesitate,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You will, however, I am\\\\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 With that he seized\\\\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There is water in your eyes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, as he released me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I perceive\\\\nthat all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\\\\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\\\\nof cobbler\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He stepped\\\\nover to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\\\\nthe vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\\\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was\\\\nnot a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\\\\nmarried man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI answered that I had not.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis face fell immediately.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dear me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he said, gravely, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\\\nto hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\\\nand spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\\\nto have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few\\\\nminutes, he said that it would be all right.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98In the case of another,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98the objection might be fatal, but\\\\nwe must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as\\\\nyours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said Vincent Spaulding. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\nshall be able to look after that for you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What would be the hours?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ten to two.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow a pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\\\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\\\\nto anything that turned up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That would suit me very well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And the pay?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a week.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And the work?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is purely nominal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What do you call purely nominal?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\\\\nwhole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.\\\\nThe will is very clear upon that point. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t comply with the\\\\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said\\\\nI.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No excuse will avail,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said Mr. Duncan Ross, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98neither sickness nor\\\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\\\\nbillet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And the work?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is to copy out the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEncyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia Britannica.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There is the first\\\\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\\\nto-morrow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Certainly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\\\ngain.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant,\\\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\\\nfortune.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in\\\\nlow spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole\\\\naffair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might\\\\nbe I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that any one\\\\ncould make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing\\\\nanything so simple as copying out the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia Britannica.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nVincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I\\\\nhad reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning\\\\nI determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle\\\\nof ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\\\nstarted off for Pope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Court.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to\\\\nsee that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and\\\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\\\\nwas right with me. At two o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\\\\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\\\\nafter me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work.\\\\nIt was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning\\\\nI was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\\\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after\\\\na time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\\\\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\\\\nnot risk the loss of it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\\\nArchery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\\\\nthat I might get on to the B\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s before very long. It cost me something\\\\nin foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.\\\\nAnd then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo an end?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\\\\nat ten o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\\\nof card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here\\\\nit is, and you can read for yourself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of\\\\nnote-paper. It read in this fashion:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\\\n   IS\\\\n   DISSOLVED.\\\\n   _October 9, 1890._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\\\nof laughter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried our client,\\\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you can do nothing\\\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\\\nhad half risen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss your case for the world. It is\\\\nmost refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\\\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you\\\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at\\\\nthe offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\\\nground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\\\nthe Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\\\\nbody. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\\\\nname was new to him.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98the gentleman at No. 4.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What, the red-headed man?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and\\\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\\\nwere ready. He moved out yesterday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where could I find him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\\\\nEdward Street, near St. Paul\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\\\\neither Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what did you do then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that\\\\nif I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,\\\\nMr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\\\\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\\\\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you did very wisely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour case is an exceedingly\\\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\\\nit than might at first sight appear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGrave enough!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, I have lost four pound a\\\\nweek.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs far as you are personally concerned,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not\\\\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \\\\xc2\\\\xa330, to say\\\\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\\\\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\\\ntheir object was in playing this prank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94if it was a prank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94upon me. It\\\\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\\\npounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\\\\nor two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called\\\\nyour attention to the advertisement\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94how long had he been with you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout a month then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did he come?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn answer to an advertisement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas he the only applicant?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I had a dozen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you pick him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause he was handy, and would come cheap.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt half-wages, in fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\\\nthough he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\\\nforehead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought as\\\\nmuch,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\\\nearrings?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a\\\\nlad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is still with\\\\nyou?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, sir; I have only just left him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing to complain of, sir. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never very much to do of a\\\\nmorning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\\\\nhope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat do you\\\\nmake of it all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI make nothing of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered, frankly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a most mysterious\\\\nbusiness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs a rule,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe more bizarre a thing is the less\\\\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\\\ndifficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you going to do, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo smoke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg\\\\nthat you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to me for fifty minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He curled himself up\\\\nin his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\\\\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\\\\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\\\\nmind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSarasate plays at the St. James\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hall this afternoon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\\\nhours?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the city first, and\\\\nwe can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\\\\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\\\\nalong!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel\\\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\\\\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and\\\\na few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a\\\\nsmoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown\\\\nboard with \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJABEZ WILSON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in white letters, upon a corner\\\\nhouse, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his\\\\nbusiness. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one\\\\nside, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\\\\npuckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again\\\\nto the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned\\\\nto the pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement\\\\nwith his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.\\\\nIt was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,\\\\nwho asked him to step in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI only wished to ask you how you would go\\\\nfrom here to the Strand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThird right, fourth left,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered the assistant, promptly, closing\\\\nthe door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSmart fellow, that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Holmes, as we walked away. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is, in my\\\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\\\nbefore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvidently,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Wilson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant counts for a good deal in\\\\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\\\\nway merely in order that you might see him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe knees of his trousers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what did you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat I expected to see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you beat the pavement?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\\\nspies in an enemy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\\\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner\\\\nfrom the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to\\\\nit as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\\\narteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.\\\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing\\\\nin a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black\\\\nwith the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize\\\\nas we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises\\\\nthat they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\\\\nsquare which we had just quitted.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along\\\\nthe line, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\\\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\\\nMortimer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\\\\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\\\\nMcFarlane\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\\\\nother block. And now, doctor, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done our work, so it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time we had\\\\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a\\\\nvery capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\\\nof Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and\\\\nhis extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\\\nthought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\\\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\\\nhis arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\\\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.\\\\nJames\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to go home, no doubt, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, as we emerged.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it would be as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\\\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy serious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\\\\nrather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt what time?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTen will be early enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well. And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He waved his hand,\\\\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always\\\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\\\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\\\nonly what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the\\\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to\\\\nmy house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary\\\\nstory of the red-headed copier of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEncyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d down to the visit\\\\nto Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted\\\\nfrom me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\\\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant was a formidable man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\\\nup in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\\\nexplanation.\\\\n\\\\nIt was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way\\\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I\\\\nheard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found\\\\nHolmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized\\\\nas Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long,\\\\nthin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\\\nfrock-coat.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! our party is complete,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket,\\\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWatson, I think\\\\nyou know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s adventure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jones, in his\\\\nconsequential way. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\\\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\npolice agent, loftily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he\\\\nwon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to\\\\nsay that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and\\\\nthe Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\\\\nforce.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the stranger,\\\\nwith deference. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\\\nfirst Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\\\\nrubber.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think you will find,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you will play for\\\\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\\\\nsome \\\\xc2\\\\xa330,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish\\\\nto lay your hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a young man,\\\\nMr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a\\\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\\\\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\\\\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\\\nknow where to find the man himself. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\\\\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\\\\nand quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\\\\nWatson and I will follow in the second.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,\\\\nand lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\\\nafternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\\\nuntil we emerged into Farringdon Street.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe are close there now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d my friend remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis fellow Merryweather\\\\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\\\\nit as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\\\\nis as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\\\\nclaws upon any one. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following\\\\nthe guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage\\\\nand through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a\\\\nsmall corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\\\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\\\\nat another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\\\\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\\\\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\\\\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes remarked, as he held\\\\nup the lantern and gazed about him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNor from below,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\\\nflags which lined the floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes,\\\\nseverely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our\\\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\\\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees\\\\nupon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to\\\\nexamine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed\\\\nto satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in\\\\nhis pocket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have at least an hour before us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor they can\\\\nhardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\\\nThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work\\\\nthe longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,\\\\ndoctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94as no doubt you have divined\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in the cellar of the city branch\\\\nof one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman\\\\nof directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the\\\\nmore daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in\\\\nthis cellar at present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is our French gold,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered the director. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have had several\\\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour French gold?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and\\\\nborrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.\\\\nIt has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the\\\\nmoney, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which\\\\nI sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\\\\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\\\\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\\\\nsubject.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich were very well justified,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now it is time\\\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\\\\nwill come to a head. In the mean time, Mr. Merryweather, we must put\\\\nthe screen over that dark lantern.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd sit in the dark?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\\\nthought that, as we were a _partie carr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e_, you might have your rubber\\\\nafter all. But I see that the enemy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s preparations have gone so far\\\\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\\\\nchoose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\\\\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\\\\nthose. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\\\\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his\\\\nlantern, and left us in pitch darkness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94such an absolute darkness\\\\nas I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained\\\\nto assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at\\\\na moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of\\\\nexpectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden\\\\ngloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have but one retreat,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is back through\\\\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\\\nasked you, Jones?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\\\nwait.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\\\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\\\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\\\\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked\\\\nup to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\\\\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\\\\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\\\\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\\\\nover the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\\\\nthe glint of a light.\\\\n\\\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\\\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\\\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white,\\\\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\\\\nof light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\\\\nprotruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\\\\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\\\\nmarked a chink between the stones.\\\\n\\\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and\\\\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\\\\nlantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\\\\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\\\\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\\\\nrested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\\\\nhole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\\\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all clear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you the chisel and the bags.\\\\nGreat Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll swing for it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\\\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\\\nas Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\\\\nrevolver, but Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hunting crop came down on the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wrist, and\\\\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no use, John Clay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, blandly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have no chance at\\\\nall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the other answered, with the utmost coolness. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy that\\\\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\\\ncompliment you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour red-headed idea was very new and\\\\neffective.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see your pal again presently,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jones. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quicker at\\\\nclimbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked\\\\nour prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may not\\\\nbe aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\\\\nwhen you address me always to say \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98sir\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, would you\\\\nplease, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\\\nhighness to the police-station?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is better,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Clay, serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\\\nthe three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from\\\\nthe cellar, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\\\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\\\nthat have ever come within my experience.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\\\nJohn Clay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been at some small expense over this\\\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\\\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\\\\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained, in the early hours of the morning,\\\\nas we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit was\\\\nperfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this\\\\nrather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the\\\\ncopying of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 must be to get this not over-bright\\\\npawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a\\\\ncurious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to\\\\nsuggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ingenious\\\\nmind by the color of his accomplice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hair. The \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a week was a lure\\\\nwhich must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for\\\\nthousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary\\\\noffice, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together\\\\nthey manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From\\\\nthe time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages,\\\\nit was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the\\\\nsituation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\\\nvulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\\\\nas they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\\\\ncould it be? I thought of the assistant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fondness for photography,\\\\nand his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the\\\\nend of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\\\nassistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest\\\\nand most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\\\\ncellar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\\\\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\\\\nIt was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\\\\nassistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never\\\\nset eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His\\\\nknees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how\\\\nworn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\\\nburrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\\\\nwalked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on\\\\nour friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\\\\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the\\\\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\nasked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s presence\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in other words,\\\\nthat they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they\\\\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might\\\\nbe removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\\\\nwould give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\\\\nexpected them to come to-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I exclaimed, in unfeigned\\\\nadmiration. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt saved me from ennui,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, yawning. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas! I already feel\\\\nit closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\\\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\\\nso.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I.\\\\n\\\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\\\nlittle use,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98L\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99homme c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99est rien\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94l\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99oeuvre c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99est\\\\ntout,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure III\\\\n\\\\nA CASE OF IDENTITY\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side\\\\nof the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clife is infinitely\\\\nstranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would\\\\nnot dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of\\\\nexistence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over\\\\nthis great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer\\\\nthings which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,\\\\nthe cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\\\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_ results, it would make all\\\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\\\\nand unprofitable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe cases which come\\\\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\\\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,\\\\nand yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\\\nartistic.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\\\nrealistic effect,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is wanting in the police\\\\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\\\\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\\\\nvital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it there is nothing so\\\\nunnatural as the commonplace.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI smiled and shook my head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can quite understand you thinking so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nI said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\\\\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\\\\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\\\nhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I picked up the morning paper from the ground\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clet us put it\\\\nto a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A\\\\nhusband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cruelty to his wife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There is half a column of print, but\\\\nI know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.\\\\nThere is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow,\\\\nthe bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\\\\ncould invent nothing more crude.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis\\\\nis the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in\\\\nclearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was\\\\na teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of\\\\nwas that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by\\\\ntaking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you\\\\nwill allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\\\\naverage story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge\\\\nthat I have scored over you in your example.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\\\ncentre of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways\\\\nand simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is\\\\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\\\\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the ring?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\\\\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\\\\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\\\\nproblems.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd have you any on hand just now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, with interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\\\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\\\\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is\\\\na field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\\\\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\\\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as\\\\na rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\\\\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\\\\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted\\\\nblinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street.\\\\nLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there\\\\nstood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large\\\\ncurling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a\\\\ncoquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under\\\\nthis great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\\\\nour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her\\\\nfingers fidgetted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as\\\\nof the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we\\\\nheard the sharp clang of the bell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen those symptoms before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, throwing his\\\\ncigarette into the fire. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOscillation upon the pavement always means an\\\\n_affaire de c\\\\xc5\\\\x93ur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\\\\ndiscriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\\\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\\\\nresolve our doubts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\\\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\\\npilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\\\nwhich he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into\\\\nan arm-chair, he looked her over in the minute, and yet abstracted\\\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not find,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat with your short sight it is a little\\\\ntrying to do so much type-writing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did at first,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she answered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut now I know where the letters\\\\nare without looking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of\\\\nhis words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard about me,\\\\nMr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9celse how could you know all that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is my business to know things.\\\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\\\nshould you come to consult me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and every one had given him\\\\nup for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\nnot rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides\\\\nthe little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know\\\\nwhat has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Sherlock\\\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.\\\\n\\\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\\\nSutherland. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I did bang out of the house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor it\\\\nmade me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is, my\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not\\\\ngo to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying\\\\nthat there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my\\\\nthings and came right away to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour father,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyour step-father, surely, since the name\\\\nis different.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, my step-father. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd your mother is alive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\\\\nwhen she married again so soon after father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death, and a man who was\\\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\\\nmother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\\\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\\\ntraveller in wines. They got \\\\xc2\\\\xa34700 for the goodwill and interest, which\\\\nwasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\\\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour own little income,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdoes it come out of the business?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle Ned\\\\nin Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4-1/2 per cent. Two\\\\nthousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the\\\\ninterest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou interest me extremely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd since you draw so large\\\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\\\ndoubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way. I believe\\\\nthat a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \\\\xc2\\\\xa360.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\\\\nthat as long as I live at home I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wish to be a burden to them, and\\\\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\\\\ncourse, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\\\\nevery quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\\\\npretty well with what I earn at type-writing. It brings me twopence a\\\\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have made your position very clear to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is\\\\nmy friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\\\nmyself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\\\nAngel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, and she picked nervously at\\\\nthe fringe of her jacket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI met him first at the gasfitters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ball,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nshe said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank\\\\ndid not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.\\\\nBut this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had\\\\nhe to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit\\\\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\\\\nout of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off\\\\nto France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I,\\\\nwith Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\\\\nHosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from\\\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\\\nwoman, for she would have her way.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see. Then at the gasfitters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ball you met, as I understand, a\\\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is to say, Mr.\\\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\\\nagain, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you know, father didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\\\nshould be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\\\\nmine yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\\\nhe had gone. We could write in the mean time, and he used to write\\\\nevery day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need\\\\nfor father to know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\\\\ntook. Hosmer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Mr. Angel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\\\nStreet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat office?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere did he live, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe slept on the premises.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know his address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94except that it was Leadenhall Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere did you address your letters, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo the Leadenhall Street Post-office, to be left till called for. He\\\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\\\ntype-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have that, for he\\\\nsaid that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they\\\\nwere type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us.\\\\nThat will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the\\\\nlittle things that he would think of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was most suggestive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt has long been an axiom of\\\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in\\\\nthe evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\\\nconspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\\\ngentle. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\\\nwhispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\\\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\\\nglasses against the glare.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your step-father, returned\\\\nto France?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should\\\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest, and made\\\\nme swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I\\\\nwould always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me\\\\nswear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his\\\\nfavor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when\\\\nthey talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father;\\\\nbut they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\\\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want\\\\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\\\nvery morning of the wedding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt missed him, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, near King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he\\\\nput us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\\\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\\\nlooked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\\\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\\\\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nHolmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\\\\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate\\\\nus, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he\\\\nwould claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\\\\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could any\\\\none have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\\\\nme? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was\\\\nvery independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of\\\\nmine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\\\\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep a wink at\\\\nnight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to\\\\nsob heavily into it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall glance into the case for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, rising; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I\\\\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight\\\\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon\\\\nit further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\\\\nmemory, as he has done from your life.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see him again?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fear not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen what has happened to him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\\\ndescription of him, and any letters of his which you can spare.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI advertised for him in last Saturday\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s _Chronicle_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere\\\\nis the slip, and here are four letters from him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. And your address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Angel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place of business?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\\\nFenchurch Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave\\\\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let\\\\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\\\\nlife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true\\\\nto Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\\\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way,\\\\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger-tips still\\\\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\\\\ndirected upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the\\\\nold and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having\\\\nlit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\\\\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he observed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI found her\\\\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\\\\na trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\\\nAndover in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\\\\nwere new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\\\nme,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\\\\nand so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\\\\nrealize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\\\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\\\\ngather from that woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s appearance? Describe it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather\\\\nof a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it,\\\\nand a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather\\\\ndarker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and\\\\nsleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right\\\\nforefinger. Her boots I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t observe. She had small, round, hanging\\\\ngold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a\\\\nvulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\\\nhave a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my boy,\\\\nbut concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a\\\\nwoman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee\\\\nof the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves,\\\\nwhich is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line\\\\na little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the\\\\ntable, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,\\\\nleaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it\\\\nfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest\\\\npart, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint\\\\nof a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon\\\\nshort sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt surprised me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised and\\\\ninterested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she\\\\nwas wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the\\\\none having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.\\\\nOne was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the\\\\nother at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young\\\\nlady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\\\\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\\\\nhurry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what else?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\\\nfriend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s incisive reasoning.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home,\\\\nbut after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\\\\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\\\\nand finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry,\\\\nand dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the\\\\nmark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing,\\\\nthough rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would\\\\nyou mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMissing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9con\\\\nthe morning of the 14th, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft. 7\\\\nin. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little\\\\nbald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted\\\\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in\\\\nblack frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,\\\\nand gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided\\\\nboots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.\\\\nAnybody bringing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d etc., etc.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs to the letters,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued,\\\\nglancing over them, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clew\\\\nin them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are type-written,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot only that, but the signature is type-written. Look at the neat\\\\nlittle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hosmer Angel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\\\\npoint about the signature is very suggestive\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in fact, we may call it\\\\nconclusive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\\\nupon the case?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to\\\\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the city, the other is\\\\nto the young lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s step-father, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he\\\\ncould meet us here at six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well\\\\nthat we should do business with the male relatives. And now, doctor, we\\\\ncan do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put\\\\nour little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s subtle powers of\\\\nreasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must\\\\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he\\\\ntreated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.\\\\nOnce only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia\\\\nand of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird\\\\nbusiness of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances\\\\nconnected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange\\\\ntangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\\\n\\\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\\\\nhe held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity\\\\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\\\n\\\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\\\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\\\\nsufferer. It was not until close upon six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock that I found myself\\\\nfree, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\\\\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _d\\\\xc3\\\\xa9nouement_\\\\nof the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\\\\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\\\narm-chair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\\\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\\\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, have you solved it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, as I entered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, the mystery!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\\\\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\\\\nof the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\\\\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\\\nSutherland?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a\\\\ntap at the door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s step-father, Mr. James Windibank,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\\\nyears of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland,\\\\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\\\ngray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\\\\ntop hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\\\\nnearest chair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that this\\\\ntype-written letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\\\nme for six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\\\\nown master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\\\\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\\\\nlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\\\\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\\\\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her\\\\nmind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\\\\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\\\\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\\\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have every reason to\\\\nbelieve that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am\\\\ndelighted to hear it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a curious thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat a type-writer has\\\\nreally quite as much individuality as a man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s handwriting. Unless they\\\\nare quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get\\\\nmore worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark\\\\nin this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\\\\nlittle slurring over of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98e,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and a slight defect in the tail of the\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98r.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\\\nobvious.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\\\ndoubt it is a little worn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,\\\\nMr. Windibank,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes continued. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think of writing another little\\\\nmonograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to\\\\ncrime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.\\\\nI have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.\\\\nThey are all type-written. In each case, not only are the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98e\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 slurred\\\\nand the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98r\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\\\\nhave alluded are there as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot\\\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf\\\\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\\\ndoor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! where?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips, and\\\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94really it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, suavely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is no\\\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\\\\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\\\\nfor me to solve so simple a question. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right! Sit down, and let\\\\nus talk it over.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter\\\\nof moisture on his brow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not actionable,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he stammered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\\\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\\\\nway as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of\\\\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\\\\nthe corner of the mantel-piece, and, leaning back with his hands in his\\\\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\\\nas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their\\\\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.\\\\nIt was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good,\\\\namiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so\\\\nthat it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her\\\\nlittle income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\\\\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\\\\ndoes her step-father do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\\\\nkeeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people\\\\nof her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever.\\\\nShe became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\\\\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\\\nstep-father do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\\\\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\\\\nthe face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\\\\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\\\ngirl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\\\\nlovers by making love himself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was only a joke at first,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d groaned our visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe never thought\\\\nthat she would have been so carried away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\\\ndecidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her\\\\nstep-father was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for\\\\nan instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\\\nadmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\\\\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go,\\\\nif a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\\\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s affections from\\\\nturning towards any one else. But the deception could not be kept up\\\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\\\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\\\nyoung lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\\\nfor some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\\\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\\\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\\\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\\\\nto another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\\\\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\\\\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other. I\\\\nthink that that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\\\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\\\\npale face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut if you are so\\\\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\\\\nbreaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\\\\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\\\\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, unlocking and\\\\nthrowing open the door, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyet there never was a man who deserved\\\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\\\\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, flushing\\\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is not\\\\npart of my duties to my client, but here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a hunting crop handy, and I\\\\nthink I shall just treat myself to\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took two swift steps to the\\\\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\\\\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\\\\ncould see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\\\nroad.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\\\nhimself down into his chair once more. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat fellow will rise from\\\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\\\\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\\\\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident,\\\\nas far as we could see, was the step-father. Then the fact that the\\\\ntwo men were never together, but that the one always appeared when\\\\nthe other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and\\\\nthe curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy\\\\nwhiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action\\\\nin type-writing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\\\\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the\\\\nsmallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with\\\\nmany minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how did you verify them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I\\\\nknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\\\ndescription, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\\\nof a disguise\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it\\\\nto the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it\\\\nanswered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already\\\\nnoticed the peculiarities of the type-writer, and I wrote to the man\\\\nhimself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. As\\\\nI expected, his reply was type-written, and revealed the same trivial\\\\nbut characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employ\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, James Windibank.\\\\n_Voila tout!_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd Miss Sutherland?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\\\\nPersian saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\\\\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There is as\\\\nmuch sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure IV\\\\n\\\\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes, and ran in this way:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from\\\\nthe West of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall\\\\nbe glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave\\\\nPaddington by the 11.15.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you say, dear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my wife, looking across at me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you\\\\ngo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you\\\\nare always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cases.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\\\nof them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I\\\\nhave only half an hour.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect\\\\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and\\\\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my\\\\nvalise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing\\\\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\\\\ntaller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt makes a\\\\nconsiderable difference to me, having some one with me on whom I can\\\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\\\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\\\\nwhich Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,\\\\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\\\\nReading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and\\\\ntossed them up onto the rack.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you heard anything of the case?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just\\\\nbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple\\\\ncases which are so extremely difficult.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clew.\\\\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is\\\\nit to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a\\\\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a murder, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted\\\\nuntil I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will\\\\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to\\\\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia, and returned some years ago to\\\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\\\\nlet to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had\\\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\\\npossible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\\\ntenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality,\\\\nas they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of\\\\neighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither\\\\nof them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of\\\\nthe neighboring English families, and to have led retired lives, though\\\\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at\\\\nthe race-meetings of the neighborhood. McCarthy kept two servants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\nman and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen\\\\nat the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\\\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn June 3, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe\\\\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the\\\\nstream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his\\\\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\\\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within\\\\na few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\\\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\\\nthe son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he\\\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly-wooded\\\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl\\\\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\\\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\\\nand close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\\\nto be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\\\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up\\\\nhis hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\\\\nviolence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home\\\\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\\\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\\\\nthe words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\\\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\\\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\\\nfresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\\\\nupon the grass beside the Pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\\\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\\\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gun, which\\\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\\\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\\\nof \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Wilful Murder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,\\\\nhe was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\\\nreferred the case to the next assizes. Those are the main facts of the\\\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf ever\\\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered Holmes,\\\\nthoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing\\\\nin an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.\\\\nIt must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\\\nculprit. There are several people in the neighborhood, however, and\\\\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighboring land-owner,\\\\nwho believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you\\\\nmay recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the\\\\ncase in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\\\\ncase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their\\\\nbreakfasts at home.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat the facts are so obvious that you will\\\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered,\\\\nlaughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\\\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\\\nemploying, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\\\\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\\\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\\\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\\\ncharacterizes you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\\\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\\\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\\\\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\\\\nthat that side is less well illuminated than the other. I could not\\\\nimagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and\\\\nbeing satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial\\\\nexample of observation and inference. Therein lies my _m\\\\xc3\\\\xa9tier_, and it\\\\nis just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation\\\\nwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were\\\\nbrought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHEY FOUND THE BODY\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing\\\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\\\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\\\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jury.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a confession,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\\\na most suspicious remark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is the brightest rift which I can\\\\nat present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\\\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\\\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\\\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy\\\\nto a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\\\nand firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\\\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\\\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\\\nmind, rather than of a guilty one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI shook my head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nI remarked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the young man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own account of the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find\\\\nit here, and may read it for yourself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\\\\nand having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which\\\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\\\noccurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read\\\\nit very carefully. It ran in this way:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and\\\\ngave evidence as follows: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I had been away from home for three days at\\\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\\\\nthe 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\\\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\\\\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\\\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\\\\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\\\\nwas going. I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of\\\\nthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren\\\\nwhich is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\\\nthinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\\\\nfront of me. When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\\\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool. He appeared to be\\\\nmuch surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was\\\\ndoing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost\\\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing\\\\nthat his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned\\\\ntowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,\\\\nwhen I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back\\\\nagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head\\\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he\\\\nalmost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then\\\\nmade my way to Mr. Turner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest,\\\\nto ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and\\\\nI have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\\\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far\\\\nas I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion\\\\nto a rat.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had\\\\nthis final quarrel?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\\\\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: I must still refuse.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 was a common signal\\\\nbetween you and your father?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: It was.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\\\\nand before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\\\nreturned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: Nothing definite.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\\\\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of\\\\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked\\\\nround for it, but it was gone.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, it was gone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You cannot say what it was?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I had a feeling something was there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98How far from the body?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A dozen yards or so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And how far from the edge of the wood?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98About the same.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\\\\nit?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, but with my back towards it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, as I glanced down the column, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat the coroner in\\\\nhis concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls\\\\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\\\\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against\\\\nthe son.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the\\\\ncushioned seat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nfavor. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\\\\ntoo much imagination and too little. Too little, if he could not invent\\\\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury;\\\\ntoo much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything\\\\nso _outr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\\\\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\\\\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\\\\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\\\\naction. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\\\\nminutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was nearly four o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock when we at last, after passing through\\\\nthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\\\\nfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,\\\\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\\\\nplatform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\\\\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\\\\ndifficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove\\\\nto the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have ordered a carriage,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade, as we sat over a cup of\\\\ntea. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy\\\\nuntil you had been on the scene of the crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is\\\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade looked startled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not quite follow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\\\\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do\\\\nnot think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have, no doubt, already formed your\\\\nconclusions from the newspapers,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe case is as plain as a\\\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\\\\nof course, one can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\\\nShe had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly\\\\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not\\\\nalready done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\\\\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, glancing from one to the other\\\\nof us, and finally, with a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quick intuition, fastening upon my\\\\ncompanion, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell\\\\nyou so. I know that James didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\\\\nthat point. We have known each other since we were little children, and\\\\nI know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\\\\nhurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to any one who really knows him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may\\\\nrely upon my doing all that I can.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do\\\\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he\\\\nis innocent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that it is very probable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere, now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, throwing back her head, and looking defiantly\\\\nat Lestrade. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that my colleague has\\\\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\\\\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn what way?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\\\\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as\\\\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little\\\\nof life yet, and\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\\\\nlike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\\\nthem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd your father?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas he in favor of such a union?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favor of\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\\\\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you for this information,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMay I see your father if I\\\\ncall to-morrow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid the doctor won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t allow it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe doctor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\\\\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is\\\\nshattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\\\\nold days in Victoria.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, at the mines.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made\\\\nhis money.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, certainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go\\\\nto the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that\\\\nI know him to be innocent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will, Miss Turner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\\\\nleave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She hurried\\\\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade, with dignity, after a few\\\\nminutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 silence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you an order to see him in prison?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but only for you and me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\\\\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but\\\\nI shall only be away a couple of hours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\\\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I\\\\nlay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed\\\\nnovel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared\\\\nto the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my\\\\nattention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that I\\\\nat last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a\\\\nconsideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy\\\\nyoung man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\\\\nabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred\\\\nbetween the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\\\\ndrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something\\\\nterrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell,\\\\nand called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim\\\\naccount of the inquest. In the surgeon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s deposition it was stated that\\\\nthe posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the\\\\noccipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.\\\\nI marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been\\\\nstruck from behind. That was to some extent in favor of the accused,\\\\nas when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still,\\\\nit did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\\\\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\\\\nHolmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference\\\\nto a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying\\\\nfrom a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more\\\\nlikely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could\\\\nit indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\\\nAnd then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young McCarthy. If\\\\nthat were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood\\\\nto return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling\\\\nwith his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries\\\\nand improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s insight that\\\\nI could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\\\\nhis conviction of young McCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s innocence.\\\\n\\\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe glass still keeps very high,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, as he sat down. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is\\\\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\\\\nground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\\\\nfor such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\\\\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what did you learn from him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould he throw no light?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\\\ndone it, and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he\\\\nis as puzzled as every one else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\\\\nthough comely to look at, and, I should think, sound at heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot admire his taste,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif it is indeed a fact that\\\\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss\\\\nTurner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\\\\ninsanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\\\\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\\\\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\\\\na barmaid in Bristol, and marry her at a registry office? No one knows\\\\na word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to\\\\nhim to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to\\\\ndo, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy\\\\nof this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\\\\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\\\\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\\\\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife\\\\nthat he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\\\\nnot know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\\\\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\\\\nthat he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown\\\\nhim over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband\\\\nalready in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\\\\nthem. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\\\nthat he has suffered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the\\\\nPool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son\\\\nwas away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that\\\\nthe murdered man was heard to cry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 before he knew that his son\\\\nhad returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.\\\\nAnd now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\\\\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\\\\nbright and cloudless. At nine o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock Lestrade called for us with the\\\\ncarriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is serious news this morning,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Lestrade observed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is said\\\\nthat Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn elderly man, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\\\\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\\\\nhas had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s,\\\\nand, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\\\\ngave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! That is interesting,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\\\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\\\\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\\\\nunder such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his\\\\nson to Turner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate,\\\\nand that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of\\\\na proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\\\\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\\\\nas much. Do you not deduce something from that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade,\\\\nwinking at me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\\\nflying away after theories and fancies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, demurely; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou do find it very hard to\\\\ntackle the facts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\\\nget hold of,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied Lestrade, with some warmth.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that is\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that\\\\nall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\\\\nleft.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, that is it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building,\\\\ntwo-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\\\nthe gray walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still\\\\nlay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\\\\ndeath, and also a pair of the son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, though not the pair which he had\\\\nthen had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\\\\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\\\\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHE MAID SHOWED US THE BOOTS.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\\\\nas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\\\\nBaker Street would have failed to recognize him. His face flushed and\\\\ndarkened. His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his\\\\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\\\\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\\\\nstood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\\\\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\\\\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question\\\\nor remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked\\\\na quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his\\\\nway along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\\\\nthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all\\\\nthat district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path\\\\nand amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes\\\\nHolmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a\\\\nlittle _d\\\\xc3\\\\xa9tour_ into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the\\\\ndetective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with\\\\nthe interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his\\\\nactions was directed towards a definite end.\\\\n\\\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\\\\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\\\\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\\\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\\\\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dwelling. On\\\\nthe Hatherley side of the Pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\\\\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\\\\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\\\\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\\\\nthe fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\\\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\\\\ntrampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\\\\nthen turned upon my companion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you go into the Pool for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\\\\nother trace. But how on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\\\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\\\\nvanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\\\\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all\\\\nover it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they\\\\nhave covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But\\\\nhere are three separate tracks of the same feet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He drew out a lens,\\\\nand lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all\\\\nthe time rather to himself than to us. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese are young McCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nfeet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles\\\\nare deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\\\\nbutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What\\\\nhave we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They\\\\ncome, they go, they come again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94of course that was for the cloak.\\\\nNow where did they come from?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ran up and down, sometimes losing,\\\\nsometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the\\\\nwood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the\\\\nneighborhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and\\\\nlay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.\\\\nFor a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried\\\\nsticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and\\\\nexamining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the\\\\ntree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss,\\\\nand this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a\\\\npathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all\\\\ntraces were lost.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, returning\\\\nto his natural manner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy that this gray house on the right must\\\\nbe the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\\\\nperhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\\\\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back\\\\ninto Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked\\\\nup in the wood.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, holding it out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe\\\\nmurder was done with it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see no marks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\\\\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\\\\nwith the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the murderer?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\\\\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket. There are\\\\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\\\\nsearch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\\\nBritish jury.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Nous verrons_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered Holmes, calmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou work your own method,\\\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\\\nprobably return to London by the evening train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd leave your case unfinished?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, finished.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the mystery?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is solved.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho was the criminal, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe gentleman I describe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut who is he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\\\npopulous neighborhood.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am a practical man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\\\\nfor a left-handed gentleman with a game-leg. I should become the\\\\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have given you the chance. Here\\\\nare your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\\\\nfound lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought\\\\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\\\\nperplexing position.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook here, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, when the cloth was cleared; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cjust sit\\\\ndown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite\\\\nknow what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar, and let\\\\nme expound.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\\\nMcCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\\\nimpressed me in his favor and you against him. One was the fact that\\\\nhis father should, according to his account, cry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 before seeing\\\\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled\\\\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\near. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\\\\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat of this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\\\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within\\\\near-shot. The \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 was meant to attract the attention of whoever\\\\nit was that he had the appointment with. But \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 is a distinctly\\\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a\\\\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\\\\nat Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in Australia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat of the rat, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\\\\nout on the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put his hand over part of\\\\nthe map. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you read?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cARAT,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I read.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He raised his hand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBALLARAT.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\\\nmurderer. So-and-so, of Ballarat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is wonderful!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I exclaimed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\\\nconsiderably. The possession of a gray garment was a third point\\\\nwhich, granting the son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We\\\\nhave come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\\\\nAustralian from Ballarat with a gray cloak.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the Pool can only be\\\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\\\nwander.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\\\\nto the personality of the criminal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how did you gain them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observance of trifles.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, they were peculiar boots.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his lameness?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\\\\nleft. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he was lame.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his left-handedness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\\\\nby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately\\\\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it\\\\nwere by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the\\\\ninterview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found\\\\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled\\\\nme to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some\\\\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\\\\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found\\\\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\\\\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which\\\\nare rolled in Rotterdam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the cigar-holder?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used\\\\na holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\\\\na clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he\\\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as\\\\nif you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in\\\\nwhich all this points. The culprit is\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. John Turner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\\\n\\\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\\\\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous\\\\nlimbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and\\\\nof character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding,\\\\ndrooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\\\\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\\\\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear\\\\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\\\ndisease.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray sit down on the sofa,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, gently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had my note?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see\\\\nme here to avoid scandal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why did you wish to see me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked across at my companion with\\\\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is\\\\nso. I know all about McCarthy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod help me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I\\\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that\\\\nI would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad to hear you say so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, gravely.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would\\\\nbreak her heart\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it will break her heart when she hears that I am\\\\narrested.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may not come to that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\\\\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young\\\\nMcCarthy must be got off, however.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am a dying man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said old Turner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have had diabetes for years. My\\\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would\\\\nrather die under my own roof than in a jail.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\\\\nbundle of paper before him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust tell us the truth,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nshall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness\\\\nit. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\\\\nyoung McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is\\\\nabsolutely needed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s as well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the old man; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a question whether I shall live\\\\nto the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare\\\\nAlice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\\\\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I\\\\ntell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.\\\\nHis grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my\\\\nlife. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was in the early sixties at the diggings. I was a young chap then,\\\\nhot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\\\\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to\\\\nthe bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway\\\\nrobber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,\\\\nsticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\\\\nroad to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\\\\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we\\\\nlay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of\\\\nus, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at\\\\nthe first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we\\\\ngot the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was\\\\nthis very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then,\\\\nbut I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face,\\\\nas though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became\\\\nwealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\\\\nThere I parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a\\\\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\\\\nin the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\\\\nto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\\\\nthough my wife died young, she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\\\\nshe was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\\\\nas nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf, and\\\\ndid my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy\\\\nlaid his grip upon me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\\\\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Here we are, Jack,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says he, touching me on the arm; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be as\\\\ngood as a family to you. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two of us, me and my son, and you can\\\\nhave the keeping of us. If you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a fine, law-abiding country\\\\nis England, and there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always a policeman within hail.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, down they came to the West country, there was no shaking them\\\\noff, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.\\\\nThere was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I\\\\nwould, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse\\\\nas Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my\\\\npast than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever\\\\nit was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last\\\\nhe asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\\\\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad\\\\nshould step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not\\\\nhave his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to\\\\nthe lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.\\\\nMcCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at\\\\nthe Pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked\\\\na cigar, and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I\\\\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to\\\\ncome uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as\\\\nlittle regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off\\\\nthe streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most\\\\ndear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\\\\nbond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\\\\nand fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my\\\\nmemory and my girl! Both could be saved, if I could but silence that\\\\nfoul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I\\\\nhave sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\\\\nmy girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\\\\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if\\\\nhe had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;\\\\nbut I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true\\\\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as the old man\\\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI pray that we may\\\\nnever be exposed to such a temptation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\\\\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes.\\\\nI will keep your confession, and, if McCarthy is condemned, I shall be\\\\nforced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and\\\\nyour secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFarewell, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the old man, solemnly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour own death-beds,\\\\nwhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which\\\\nyou have given to mine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame,\\\\nhe stumbled slowly from the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod help us!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, after a long silence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy does fate play\\\\nsuch tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\\\\nthis that I do not think of Baxter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s words, and say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There, but for\\\\nthe grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes, on the strength of a\\\\nnumber of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes, and submitted\\\\nto the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our\\\\ninterview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son\\\\nand daughter may come to live happily together, in ignorance of the\\\\nblack cloud which rests upon their past.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure V\\\\n\\\\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\\\nbetween the years \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9982 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9990, I am faced by so many which present\\\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know\\\\nwhich to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained\\\\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field\\\\nfor those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a\\\\ndegree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\\\\ntoo, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\\\\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\\\\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\\\\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\\\\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\\\\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\\\\nsome account of it, in spite of the fact that there are points in\\\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\\\nentirely cleared up.\\\\n\\\\nThe year \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater\\\\nor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings\\\\nunder this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of\\\\nthe Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a\\\\nluxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the\\\\nfacts connected with the loss of the British bark _Sophy Anderson_, of\\\\nthe singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa,\\\\nand finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may\\\\nbe remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\\\\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a deduction\\\\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these\\\\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such\\\\nsingular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have\\\\nnow taken up my pen to describe.\\\\n\\\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had\\\\nset in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the\\\\nrain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart\\\\nof great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the\\\\ninstant from the routine of life, and to recognize the presence of\\\\nthose great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars\\\\nof his civilization, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in,\\\\nthe storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a\\\\nchild in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\\\\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\\\\ndeep in one of Clark Russell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fine sea-stories, until the howl of the\\\\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\\\\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was\\\\non a visit to her mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, glancing up at my companion, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat was surely the bell.\\\\nWho could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcept yourself I have none,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not encourage\\\\nvisitors.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA client, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on\\\\nsuch a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to\\\\nbe some crony of the landlady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came\\\\na step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his\\\\nlong arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant\\\\nchair upon which a new-comer must sit. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome in!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\\\nin his bearing. The steaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and\\\\nhis long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he\\\\nhad come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and\\\\nI could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a\\\\nman who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI owe you an apology,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, raising his golden _pince-nez_ to his\\\\neyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some\\\\ntraces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive me your coat and umbrella,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey may rest here\\\\non the hook, and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\\\\nsouth-west, I see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, from Horsham.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe-caps is quite\\\\ndistinctive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have come for advice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is easily got.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd help.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is not always so easy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how\\\\nyou saved him in the Tankerville Club Scandal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe said that you could solve anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe said too much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat you are never beaten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been beaten four times\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94three times by men, and once by a\\\\nwoman.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you may be so with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favor me with\\\\nsome details as to your case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is no ordinary one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have\\\\never listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events\\\\nthan those which have happened in my own family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou fill me with interest,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray give us the essential\\\\nfacts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\\\\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe young man pulled his chair up, and pushed his wet feet out towards\\\\nthe blaze.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far\\\\nas I can understand it, little to do with this awful business. It is an\\\\nhereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must\\\\ngo back to the commencement of the affair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94my uncle Elias and\\\\nmy father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which\\\\nhe enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was the\\\\npatentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with\\\\nsuch success that he was able to sell it, and to retire upon a handsome\\\\ncompetence.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man, and\\\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done\\\\nvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s army, and\\\\nafterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid\\\\ndown his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained\\\\nfor three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe,\\\\nand took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very\\\\nconsiderable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was\\\\nhis aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy\\\\nin extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\\\\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most\\\\nretiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham I\\\\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three\\\\nfields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though\\\\nvery often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank\\\\na great deal of brandy, and smoked very heavily, but he would see no\\\\nsociety, and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind me, in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\\\\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be\\\\nin the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\\\\nbegged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me\\\\nin his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon\\\\nand draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with\\\\nthe servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\\\\nsixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys, and could\\\\ngo where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\\\\nin his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had\\\\na single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably\\\\nlocked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\\\\nenter. With a boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s curiosity I have peeped through the key-hole, but\\\\nI was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and\\\\nbundles as would be expected in such a room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it was in March, 1883\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a letter with a foreign stamp lay\\\\nupon the table in front of the Colonel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plate. It was not a common\\\\nthing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in\\\\nready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98From India!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he,\\\\nas he took it up, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Opening\\\\nit hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which\\\\npattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh\\\\nwas struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen,\\\\nhis eyes were protruding, his skin the color of putty, and he glared at\\\\nthe envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98K. K. K.!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\nshrieked, and then, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What is it, uncle?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Death,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,\\\\nleaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope, and saw\\\\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter\\\\nK three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried\\\\npips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the\\\\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with\\\\nan old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,\\\\nand a small brass box, like a cash-box, in the other.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98They may do what they like, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll checkmate them still,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he,\\\\nwith an oath. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,\\\\nand send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step\\\\nup to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there\\\\nwas a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\\\\nbox stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,\\\\nwith a start, that upon the lid were printed the treble K which I had\\\\nread in the morning upon the envelope.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I wish you, John,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said my uncle, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98to witness my will. I leave\\\\nmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my\\\\nbrother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\\\\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my\\\\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to\\\\ngive you such a two-edged thing, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say what turn things are\\\\ngoing to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression\\\\nupon me, and I pondered over it, and turned it every way in my mind\\\\nwithout being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\\\\nthe vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation\\\\ngrew less keen as the weeks passed, and nothing happened to disturb\\\\nthe usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle,\\\\nhowever. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any\\\\nsort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the\\\\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort\\\\nof drunken frenzy, and would burst out of the house and tear about the\\\\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid\\\\nof no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,\\\\nby man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\\\ntumultuously in at the door, and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\\\\nwho can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\\\\nroots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\\\\nday, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\\\\nyour patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\\\\nsallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\\\\nsearch for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\\\\nat the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\\\\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\\\\nknown eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. But I, who knew\\\\nhow he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\\\\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\\\\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\\\\nsome \\\\xc2\\\\xa314,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne moment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes interposed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour statement is, I foresee, one\\\\nof the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the\\\\ndate of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\\\\nsupposed suicide.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe latter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\\\nupon the night of May 2d.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. Pray proceed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\\\\nthe inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\\\\nK. repeated upon it, and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nwritten beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\\\\nwhich had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\\\\nnothing of much importance in the attic, save a great many scattered\\\\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life in America. Some\\\\nof them were of the war time, and showed that he had done his duty\\\\nwell, and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a\\\\ndate during the reconstruction of the Southern States, and were mostly\\\\nconcerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in\\\\nopposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the\\\\nNorth.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it was the beginning of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9984 when my father came to live at\\\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January\\\\nof \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a\\\\nsharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There\\\\nhe was, sitting with a newly-opened envelope in one hand and five dried\\\\norange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always\\\\nlaughed at what he called my cock-and-a-bull story about the Colonel,\\\\nbut he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come\\\\nupon himself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he stammered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy heart had turned to lead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is K. K. K.,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe looked inside the envelope. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98So it is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Here are the\\\\nvery letters. But what is this written above them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Put the papers on the sundial,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What papers? What sundial?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but the\\\\npapers must be those that are destroyed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Pooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98We are in a civilized\\\\nland here, and we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the\\\\nthing come from?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98From Dundee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, glancing at the post-mark.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Some preposterous practical joke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What have I to do with\\\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should certainly speak to the police,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then let me do so?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I forbid you. I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\\\\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from\\\\nhome to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command\\\\nof one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\\\\nfor it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\\\\nfrom home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\\\\nabsence I received a telegram from the Major, imploring me to come at\\\\nonce. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\\\\nin the neighborhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\\\\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\\\\nconsciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\\\\nthe twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Death\\\\nfrom accidental causes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Carefully as I examined every fact connected\\\\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\\\\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\\\\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And\\\\nyet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I\\\\nwas wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why\\\\nI did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that\\\\nour troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nlife, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in\\\\nanother.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was in January, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9985, that my poor father met his end, and two years\\\\nand eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\\\\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\\\\naway from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\\\\nhad begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\\\\nfell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and, turning\\\\nto the table, he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the envelope,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe post-mark is London\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94eastern\\\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s last\\\\nmessage: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98K. K. K.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99; and then \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Put the papers on the sundial.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have you done?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo tell the truth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he sank his face into his thin, white hands\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nhave felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when\\\\nthe snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some\\\\nresistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\\\\nguard against.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTut! tut!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Sherlock Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must act, man, or you are lost.\\\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen the police.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\\\\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as\\\\nthe jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIncredible imbecility!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\ncried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\\\nhouse with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHas he come with you to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you come to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand, above all, why did you not\\\\ncome at once?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\\\\nabout my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\\\\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which\\\\nyou have placed before us\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94no suggestive detail which might help us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is one thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\\\npocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored, blue-tinted paper, he\\\\nlaid it out upon the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have some remembrance,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat\\\\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\\\\nunburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\\\\ncolor. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am\\\\ninclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\\\\nfluttered out from among the others, and in that way have escaped\\\\ndestruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\\\\nmuch. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\\\\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It\\\\nwas headed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMarch, 1869,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and beneath were the following enigmatical\\\\nnotices:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St.\\\\nAugustine.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c9th. McCauley cleared.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c10th. John Swain cleared.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, folding up the paper, and returning it to\\\\nour visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We\\\\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get\\\\nhome instantly and act.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat shall I do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put\\\\nthis piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which\\\\nyou have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the\\\\nother papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only\\\\none which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry\\\\nconviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box\\\\nout upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEntirely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\\\\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to\\\\nweave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to\\\\nremove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear\\\\nup the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you\\\\nadvise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy train from Waterloo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you\\\\nmay be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am armed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to\\\\nthe box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe shook hands with us, and took his leave. Outside the wind still\\\\nscreamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.\\\\nThis strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad\\\\nelements\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and now\\\\nto have been reabsorbed by them once more.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\\\\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit\\\\nhis pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings\\\\nas they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked at last, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat of all our cases we have\\\\nhad none more fantastic than this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to\\\\nme to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut have you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cformed any definite conception as to what\\\\nthese perils are?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere can be no question as to their nature,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\\\\nunhappy family?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms\\\\nof his chair, with his finger-tips together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe ideal reasoner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nremarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all\\\\nits bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which\\\\nled up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As\\\\nCuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of\\\\na single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link\\\\nin a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the\\\\nother ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results\\\\nwhich the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the\\\\nstudy which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the\\\\naid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch,\\\\nit is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the\\\\nfacts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies,\\\\nas you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even\\\\nin these days of free education and encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dias, is a somewhat rare\\\\naccomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\\\\npossess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\\\\nand this I have endeavored in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you\\\\non one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\\\\nin a very precise fashion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a singular document. Philosophy,\\\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\\\\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region\\\\nwithin fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,\\\\nsensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,\\\\nswordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I\\\\nthink, were the main points of my analysis.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say now, as I said\\\\nthen, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\\\\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away\\\\nin the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants\\\\nit. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us\\\\nto-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand\\\\nme down the letter K of the American Encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia which stands upon\\\\nthe shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation,\\\\nand see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start\\\\nwith a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong\\\\nreason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all\\\\ntheir habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida\\\\nfor the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of\\\\nsolitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one\\\\nor something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear\\\\nof some one or something which drove him from America. As to what it\\\\nwas he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable\\\\nletters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you\\\\nremark the post-marks of those letters?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\\\nfrom London.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent. We have already a clew. There can be no doubt that the\\\\nprobability\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the strong probability\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94is that the writer was on board\\\\nof a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of\\\\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\\\\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest\\\\nanything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA greater distance to travel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I do not see the point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\\\\nor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always sent their\\\\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\\\\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\\\\nDundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would\\\\nhave arrived almost as soon as their letter. But as a matter of fact\\\\nseven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the\\\\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the\\\\nsailing-vessel which brought the writer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\\\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has\\\\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\\\\ntravel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we\\\\ncannot count upon delay.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance\\\\nto the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite\\\\nclear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not\\\\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\njury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\\\\nof resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the\\\\nholder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\\\\nthe initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut of what society?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you never\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking\\\\nhis voice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere it\\\\nis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, presently, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the\\\\nfanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This\\\\nterrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in\\\\nthe Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local\\\\nbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,\\\\nLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used\\\\nfor political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro\\\\nvoters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who\\\\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by\\\\na warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally\\\\nrecognized shape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or\\\\norange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly\\\\nabjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the\\\\nmatter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some\\\\nstrange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organization of the\\\\nsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case\\\\nupon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in\\\\nwhich any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For\\\\nsome years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the\\\\nUnited States Government and of the better classes of the community in\\\\nthe South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly\\\\ncollapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort\\\\nsince that date.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will observe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat the\\\\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\\\\nof Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\\\\nmore implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this\\\\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\\\\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\\\\nrecovered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen the page we have seen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98sent the\\\\npips to A, B, and C,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is, sent the society\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s warning to them.\\\\nThen there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the\\\\ncountry, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister\\\\nresult for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into\\\\nthis dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has\\\\nin the mean time is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more\\\\nto be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin, and let\\\\nus try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still\\\\nmore miserable ways of our fellow-men.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.\\\\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have, I\\\\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\\\nOpenshaw\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat steps will you take?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\\\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will not go there first?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I shall commence with the city. Just ring the bell, and the maid\\\\nwill bring up your coffee.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced\\\\nmy eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou are too late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, laying down his cup, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feared as much. How was it\\\\ndone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tragedy near\\\\nWaterloo Bridge.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Here is the account: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Between nine and ten last\\\\nnight Police-constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo\\\\nBridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night,\\\\nhowever, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help\\\\nof several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.\\\\nThe alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police,\\\\nthe body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young\\\\ngentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in\\\\nhis pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It\\\\nis conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last\\\\ntrain from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme\\\\ndarkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the\\\\nsmall landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces\\\\nof violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been\\\\nthe victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect\\\\nof calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the\\\\nriver-side landing-stages.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a petty\\\\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter\\\\nwith me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this\\\\ngang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him\\\\naway to his death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room\\\\nin uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a\\\\nnervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey must be cunning devils,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he exclaimed, at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could they\\\\nhave decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line\\\\nto the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\\\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in\\\\nthe long run. I am going out now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I CRIED, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98YOU ARE TOO LATE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo the police?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take\\\\nthe flies, but not before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the\\\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\\\nback yet. It was nearly ten o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock before he entered, looking pale\\\\nand worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the\\\\nloaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught\\\\nof water.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are hungry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\\\nbreakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how have you succeeded?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have a clew?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\\\nupon them. It is well thought of!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and, tearing it to pieces, he\\\\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five, and thrust\\\\nthem into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cS. H. for J.\\\\nO.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then he sealed it and addressed it to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCaptain James Calhoun, Bark\\\\n_Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will await him when he enters port,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, chuckling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may\\\\ngive him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his\\\\nfate as Openshaw did before him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you trace it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates\\\\nand names.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have spent the whole day,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cover Lloyd\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s registers and the\\\\nfiles of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel\\\\nwhich touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9983. There\\\\nwere thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during\\\\nthose months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my\\\\nattention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from\\\\nLondon, the name is that which is given to one of the States of the\\\\nUnion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTexas, I think.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\\\nAmerican origin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the bark _Lone\\\\nStar_ was there in January, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9985, my suspicion became a certainty. I\\\\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\\\\nLondon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\\\nDock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early\\\\ntide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend,\\\\nand learned that she had passed some time ago; and as the wind is\\\\neasterly, I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins, and not\\\\nvery far from the Isle of Wight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat will you do, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are, as I learn,\\\\nthe only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and\\\\nGermans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last\\\\nnight. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By\\\\nthe time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will\\\\nhave carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police\\\\nof Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a\\\\ncharge of murder.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and\\\\nthe murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips\\\\nwhich would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as\\\\nthemselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the\\\\nequinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone\\\\nStar_ of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that\\\\nsomewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was\\\\nseen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cL. S.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d carved\\\\nupon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the\\\\n_Lone Star_.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure VI\\\\n\\\\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\\\nTheological College of St. George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, was much addicted to opium. The\\\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he\\\\nwas at college; for having read De Quincey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s description of his dreams\\\\nand sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt\\\\nto produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that\\\\nthe practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years\\\\nhe continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror\\\\nand pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,\\\\npasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\\\\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\\\n\\\\nOne night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it was in June, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9989\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94there came a ring to my bell, about the\\\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up\\\\nin my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made\\\\na little face of disappointment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA patient!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to go out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\\\n\\\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps\\\\nupon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some\\\\ndark-colored stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse my calling so late,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she began, and then, suddenly\\\\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my\\\\nwife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in such trouble!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nshe cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do so want a little help.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my wife, pulling up her veil, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is Kate Whitney. How you\\\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d That was always\\\\nthe way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\\\\nlight-house.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you\\\\nrather that I sent James off to bed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no, no! I want the Doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s advice and help, too. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about Isa.\\\\nHe has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school\\\\ncompanion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.\\\\nDid she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring\\\\nhim back to her?\\\\n\\\\nIt seemed that it was. She had the surest information that of late he\\\\nhad, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest\\\\neast of the city. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one\\\\nday, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.\\\\nBut now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay\\\\nthere, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison\\\\nor sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of\\\\nit, at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBar of Gold,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to\\\\ndo? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a\\\\nplace, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded\\\\nhim?\\\\n\\\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.\\\\nMight I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,\\\\nwhy should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s medical adviser, and\\\\nas such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were\\\\nalone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a\\\\ncab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had\\\\ngiven me. And so in ten minutes I had left my arm-chair and cheery\\\\nsitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\\\\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only\\\\ncould show how strange it was to be.\\\\n\\\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.\\\\nUpper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves\\\\nwhich line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.\\\\nBetween a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of\\\\nsteps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the\\\\nden of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down\\\\nthe steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken\\\\nfeet, and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found\\\\nthe latch, and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy\\\\nwith the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\\\n\\\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back\\\\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye\\\\nturned upon the new-comer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered\\\\nlittle red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning\\\\npoison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay\\\\nsilent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in\\\\na strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes,\\\\nand then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own\\\\nthoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbor. At the\\\\nfarther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a\\\\nthree-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw\\\\nresting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into\\\\nthe fire.\\\\n\\\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for\\\\nme and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. I have not come to stay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is a friend of\\\\nmine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and, peering\\\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring\\\\nout at me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy God! It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,\\\\nwith every nerve in a twitter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say, Watson, what o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly eleven.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf what day?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf Friday, June 19th.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you\\\\nwant to frighten a chap for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sank his face onto his arms, and began\\\\nto sob in a high treble key.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\\\\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I am. But you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\\\nhours, three pipes, four pipes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I forget how many. But I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go home\\\\nwith you. I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t frighten Kate\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94poor little Kate. Give me your\\\\nhand! Have you a cab?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I have one waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\\\\nWatson. I am all off color. I can do nothing for myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,\\\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,\\\\nand looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat\\\\nby the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice\\\\nwhispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWalk past me, and then look back at me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The words fell\\\\nquite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come\\\\nfrom the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,\\\\nvery thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down\\\\nfrom between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude\\\\nfrom his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took\\\\nall my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\\\\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but\\\\nI. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had\\\\nregained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at\\\\nmy surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight\\\\nmotion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half\\\\nround to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped\\\\nsenility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs low as you can,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have excellent ears. If you would\\\\nhave the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\\\\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have a cab outside.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\\\\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you\\\\nalso to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\\\\nthrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with\\\\nyou in five minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s requests, for they\\\\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet\\\\nair of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined\\\\nin the cab my mission was practically accomplished, and for the rest,\\\\nI could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend\\\\nin one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of\\\\nhis existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nbill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness.\\\\nIn a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium\\\\nden, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two\\\\nstreets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then,\\\\nglancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a\\\\nhearty fit of laughter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you imagine that I have added\\\\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\\\\nweaknesses on which you have favored me with your medical views.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut not more so than I to find you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI came to find a friend.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I to find an enemy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn enemy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and\\\\nI have hoped to find a clew in the incoherent ramblings of these\\\\nsots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognized in that den my\\\\nlife would not have been worth an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s purchase; for I have used it\\\\nbefore now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has\\\\nsworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of\\\\nthat building, near the corner of Paul\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wharf, which could tell some\\\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! You do not mean bodies?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAye, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 for every\\\\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest\\\\nmurder-trap on the whole river-side, and I fear that Neville St. Clair\\\\nhas entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\nsignal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance,\\\\nfollowed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nhoofs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\\\nlanterns. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come with me, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I can be of use.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\\\nMy room at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Cedars\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 is a double-bedded one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Cedars?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; that is Mr. St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. I am staying there while I conduct\\\\nthe inquiry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere is it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am all in the dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course you are. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.\\\\nAll right, John; we shall not need you. Here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s half a crown. Look out\\\\nfor me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with\\\\nthe murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\\\\nbelated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the\\\\nsky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts\\\\nof the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside\\\\nhim, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax\\\\nhis powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\\\\nhis thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get\\\\nto the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\\\\nshrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\\\\nhas satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt makes you\\\\nquite invaluable as a companion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Pon my word, it is a great thing\\\\nfor me to have some one to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over\\\\npleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman\\\\nto-night when she meets me at the door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\\\\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, I can get nothing\\\\nto go upon. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the end\\\\nof it into my hand. Now, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll state the case clearly and concisely to\\\\nyou, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProceed, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome years ago\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94to be definite, in May, 1884\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94there came to Lee a\\\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty\\\\nof money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely,\\\\nand lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the\\\\nneighborhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by\\\\nwhom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested\\\\nin several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning,\\\\nreturning by the 5.14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is\\\\nnow thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good\\\\nhusband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all\\\\nwho know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\\\\nas far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \\\\xc2\\\\xa388 10_s._, while\\\\nhe has \\\\xc2\\\\xa3220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been\\\\nweighing upon his mind.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier\\\\nthan usual, remarking before he started that he had two important\\\\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\\\\nbox of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\\\\nupon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\\\\nthat a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\\\\nwas waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\\\\nNow, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the offices\\\\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\\\\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\\\\nstarted for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking\\\\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed\\\\nme so far?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very clear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.\\\\nClair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as\\\\nshe did not like the neighborhood in which she found herself. While\\\\nshe was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\\\\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\\\\nat her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\\\\nwindow. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\\\\ndescribes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically\\\\nto her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed\\\\nto her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\\\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was\\\\nthat, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town\\\\nin, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS SHE MET THIS LASCAR\\\\nSCOUNDREL.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\\\nsteps\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\\\\nfound me to-night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and, running through the front room, she attempted\\\\nto ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the\\\\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\\\\nwho thrust her back, and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\\\\npushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\\\\nand fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good-fortune, met, in\\\\nFresno Street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\\\\nway to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and,\\\\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\\\\nway to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\\\\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\\\\nto be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\\\\nmade his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined\\\\nwas their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come\\\\nto believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded, when, with a cry, she\\\\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid\\\\nfrom it. Out there fell a cascade of children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bricks. It was the toy\\\\nwhich he had promised to bring home.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\\\\nmade the inspector realize that the matter was serious. The rooms were\\\\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.\\\\nThe front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a\\\\nsmall bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.\\\\nBetween the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is\\\\ndry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and\\\\na half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one, and opened\\\\nfrom below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the\\\\nwindow-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden\\\\nfloor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room\\\\nwere all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of\\\\nhis coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94all were there.\\\\nThere were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there\\\\nwere no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he\\\\nmust apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and\\\\nthe ominous blood-stains upon the sill gave little promise that he\\\\ncould save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at\\\\nthe moment of the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\\\\nbut as, by Mrs. St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story, he was known to have been at the\\\\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s appearance\\\\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\\\\ncrime. His defense was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\\\\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\\\\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\\\\ngentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s clothes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the\\\\nlast human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name\\\\nis Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every\\\\nman who goes much to the city. He is a professional beggar, though,\\\\nin order to avoid the police regulations, he pretends to a small\\\\ntrade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street,\\\\nupon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small\\\\nangle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\\\ncross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and, as he is\\\\na piteous spectacle, a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\\\\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the\\\\nfellow more than once, before ever I thought of making his professional\\\\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\\\\nreaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\\\\nno one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a\\\\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction,\\\\nhas turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a\\\\npair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast\\\\nto the color of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common\\\\ncrowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready\\\\nwith a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the\\\\npassers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger\\\\nat the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of\\\\nwhom we are in quest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut a cripple!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat could he have done single-handed against\\\\na man in the prime of life?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your\\\\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\\\\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray continue your narrative.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence\\\\ncould be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton,\\\\nwho had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\\\\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\\\\nmatter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\\\\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\\\\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\\\\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\\\\nincriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\\\\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\\\\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\\\\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\\\\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\\\\nsource. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair,\\\\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much\\\\na mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assertion\\\\nthat she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that\\\\nshe must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\\\\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\\\\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\\\\nclew.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat, and not Neville St.\\\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think\\\\nthey found in the pockets?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies\\\\nand half-pennies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\\\\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\\\\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\\\\nhouse. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\\\\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that\\\\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there\\\\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?\\\\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\\\\ntell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\\\\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\\\\nsink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle down-stairs when\\\\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\\\\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\\\\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret horde,\\\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\\\\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\\\\nof the coat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\\\\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\\\\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt certainly sounds feasible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\\\\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\\\\nhim. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\\\\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter\\\\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94what\\\\nNeville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him\\\\nwhen there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\\\\ndisappearance\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I\\\\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\\\\nglance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\\\\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town\\\\nuntil the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled\\\\nalong with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,\\\\nhowever, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights\\\\nstill glimmered in the windows.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my companion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have touched\\\\non three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\\\\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light\\\\namong the trees? That is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Cedars,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and beside that lamp sits a\\\\nwoman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the\\\\nclink of our horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs.\\\\nSt. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may\\\\nrest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend\\\\nand colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her\\\\nhusband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own\\\\ngrounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, and, springing\\\\ndown, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to\\\\nthe house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde\\\\nwoman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de\\\\nsoie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She\\\\nstood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand\\\\nupon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly\\\\nbent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\\\nstanding question.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And then, seeing that there were two of\\\\nus, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my\\\\ncompanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo good news?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo bad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\\\nlong day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am delighted to see you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she, pressing my hand warmly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly\\\\nupon us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not,\\\\nI can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\\\\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\\\nhappy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the lady, as we entered a well-lit\\\\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\\\\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, madam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUpon what point?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrankly,\\\\nnow!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at\\\\nhim as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou think that he is dead?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMurdered?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say that. Perhaps.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn Monday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he roared.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, to-day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in\\\\nthe air.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMay I see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon\\\\nthe table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently. I had left\\\\nmy chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a\\\\nvery coarse one, and was stamped with the Gravesend post-mark, and with\\\\nthe date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was\\\\nconsiderably after midnight.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCoarse writing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSurely this is not your husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nwriting, madam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but the enclosure is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\\\\ninquire as to the address.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow can you tell that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\\\nThe rest is of the grayish color, which shows that blotting-paper has\\\\nbeen used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none\\\\nwould be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and\\\\nthere has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only\\\\nmean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but\\\\nthere is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.\\\\nHa! there has been an enclosure here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of his hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\\\\nand yet I know it well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a\\\\nhuge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\\\\npatience.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Neville.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\\\\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man\\\\nwith a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very\\\\nmuch in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have\\\\nno doubt that it is your husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, madam?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone. Neville wrote those words.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\\\\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\\\\nover.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The\\\\nring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday, and only\\\\nposted to-day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf so, much may have happened between.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well\\\\nwith him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if\\\\nevil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself\\\\nin the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed up-stairs instantly\\\\nwith the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think\\\\nthat I would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his\\\\ndeath?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may\\\\nbe more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And\\\\nin this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\\\\ncorroborate your view. But if your husband is alive, and able to write\\\\nletters, why should he remain away from you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery much so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas the window open?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen he might have called to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe might.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA call for help, you thought?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. He waved his hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\\\\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe disappeared so suddenly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe might have leaped back. You did not see any one else in the room?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the\\\\nLascar was at the foot of the stairs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\\\\nclothes on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which\\\\nI wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and\\\\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\\\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\\\\nmy night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when\\\\nhe had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even\\\\nfor a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts,\\\\nlooking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed\\\\nit, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon\\\\nevident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He\\\\ntook off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown,\\\\nand then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and\\\\ncushions from the sofa and arm-chairs. With these he constructed a sort\\\\nof Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\\\\nounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.\\\\nIn the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar\\\\npipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with\\\\nthe light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I\\\\ndropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\\\\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\\\\npipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\\\\nroom was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\\\\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAwake, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGame for a morning drive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\\\\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He chuckled to himself\\\\nas he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\\\\nsombre thinker of the previous night.\\\\n\\\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished\\\\nwhen Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the\\\\nhorse.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to test a little theory of mine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, pulling on his\\\\nboots. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\\\\none of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\\\\nhere to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd where is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, smiling.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the bath-room,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I am not joking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have just been there, and\\\\nI have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\\\\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe made our way down-stairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\\\\nbright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with\\\\nthe half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and\\\\naway we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\\\\nbearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\\\\neither side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt has been in some points a singular case,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, flicking the\\\\nhorse on into a gallop. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\\\\nbut it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\\\\ntheir windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\\\\nPassing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\\\\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right, and found\\\\nourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the Force,\\\\nand the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the\\\\nhorse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head while the other led us in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho is on duty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A tall, stout official had come down the\\\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wish to\\\\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\\\\nand a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\\\\ndesk.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI called about that beggarman, Boone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the one who was charged with\\\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I heard. You have him here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the cells.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs he quiet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDirty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\\\\nas black as a tinker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\\\\nwill have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\\\\nagree with me that he needed it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should like to see him very much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I think that I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He led us down a passage,\\\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe third on the right is his,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the inspector. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere it is!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He\\\\nquietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\\\\nthrough.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is asleep,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can see him very well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\\\\ntowards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\\\\na middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored\\\\nshirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the\\\\ninspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his\\\\nface could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an\\\\nold scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction\\\\nhad turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were\\\\nexposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low\\\\nover his eyes and forehead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a beauty, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the inspector.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe certainly needs a wash,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had an idea that he\\\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened\\\\nthe Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\\\\nlarge bath-sponge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe! he! You are a funny one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d chuckled the inspector.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\\\\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the inspector. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look\\\\na credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He slipped his key into\\\\nthe lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\\\\nturned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\\\\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\\\\ntwice vigorously across and down the prisoner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me introduce you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\\\\nin the county of Kent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face peeled off\\\\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\\\\ntint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\\\\nthe twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\\\\ntwitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in\\\\nhis bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\\\\nsmooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy\\\\nbewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a\\\\nscream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the inspector, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is, indeed, the missing man.\\\\nI know him from the photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\\\\nto his destiny. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe it so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd pray, what am I charged with?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Oh, come, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be\\\\ncharged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid the inspector, with a grin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have been twenty-seven years\\\\nin the force, but this really takes the cake.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\\\\nbeen committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was not the wife, it was the children,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d groaned the prisoner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod\\\\nhelp me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\\\nexposure! What can I do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\\\non the shoulder.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\\\\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\\\\nyou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\\\\nfind their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\\\\nmake notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the\\\\nproper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod bless you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the prisoner, passionately. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would have\\\\nendured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my\\\\nmiserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was\\\\na school-master in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent\\\\neducation. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally\\\\nbecame a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor\\\\nwished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis,\\\\nand I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all\\\\nmy adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur\\\\nthat I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an\\\\nactor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had\\\\nbeen famous in the greenroom for my skill. I took advantage now of\\\\nmy attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\\\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist\\\\nby the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster. Then with a red\\\\nhead of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the\\\\nbusiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a\\\\nbeggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in\\\\nthe evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than\\\\n26_s._ 4_d._\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some\\\\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon\\\\nme for \\\\xc2\\\\xa325. I was at my wits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end where to get the money, but a sudden\\\\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s grace from the creditor, asked\\\\nfor a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\\\\ncity under my disguise. In ten days I had the money, and had paid the\\\\ndebt.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous\\\\nwork at \\\\xc2\\\\xa32 a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\\\\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\\\\nsitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money,\\\\nbut the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day\\\\nafter day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my\\\\nghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew\\\\nmy secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in\\\\nSwandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar,\\\\nand in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about\\\\ntown. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that\\\\nI knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\\\\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \\\\xc2\\\\xa3700\\\\na year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94which is less than my average takings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but I had exceptional\\\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\\\\nrepartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized\\\\ncharacter in the city. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\\\\npoured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xa32.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\\\\nand eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my\\\\nreal occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the city. She\\\\nlittle knew what.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLast Monday I had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room\\\\nabove the opium den, when I looked out of my window, and saw, to my\\\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\\\\nher eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\\\\nto cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\\\\nhim to prevent any one from coming up to me. I heard her voice\\\\ndown-stairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\\\\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\\\\nwig. Even a wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\\\\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\\\\nthat the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening\\\\nby my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\\\\nbedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by\\\\nthe coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag\\\\nin which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\\\\ndisappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\\\\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\\\\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead\\\\nof being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\\\\nmurderer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring, and confided it to the Lascar at a\\\\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\\\\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat note only reached her yesterday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood God! What a week she must have spent!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe police have watched this Lascar,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Inspector Bradstreet, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand\\\\nI can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\\\\nunobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\\\\nforgot all about it for some days.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have no doubt of\\\\nit. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must stop here, however,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Bradstreet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf the police are to\\\\nhush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\\\\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,\\\\nMr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared\\\\nthe matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI reached this one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my friend, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cby sitting upon five pillows and\\\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure VII\\\\n\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of\\\\nthe season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,\\\\na pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\\\\nmorning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch\\\\nwas a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy\\\\nand disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\\\\nin several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the\\\\nchair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\\\\npurpose of examination.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are engaged,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cperhaps I interrupt you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\\\\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (he jerked his thumb in\\\\nthe direction of the old hat), \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut there are points in connection with\\\\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his\\\\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\\\\nthick with the ice crystals. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat, homely as\\\\nit looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that it is\\\\nthe clew which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the\\\\npunishment of some crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no. No crime,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly one of\\\\nthose whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have\\\\nfour million human beings all jostling each other within the space of\\\\na few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm\\\\nof humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to\\\\ntake place, and many a little problem will be presented which may\\\\nbe striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had\\\\nexperience of such.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat of the last six cases which I have\\\\nadded to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\\\\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of\\\\nthe man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small\\\\nmatter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,\\\\nthe commissionaire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is his hat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look\\\\nupon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem.\\\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,\\\\nin company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting\\\\nat this moment in front of Peterson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fire. The facts are these: about\\\\nfour o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a\\\\nvery honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and\\\\nwas making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him\\\\nhe saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,\\\\nand carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\\\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\\\\nlittle knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat, on\\\\nwhich he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his\\\\nhead, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward\\\\nto protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\\\\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\\\\nuniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\\\\nvanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\\\\nTottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\\\\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\\\\nalso of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\\\\nmost unimpeachable Christmas goose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98For Mrs.\\\\nHenry Baker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nleft leg, and it is also true that the initials \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98H. B.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 are legible\\\\nupon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\\\\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy\\\\nto restore lost property to any one of them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The\\\\ngoose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in\\\\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten\\\\nwithout unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to\\\\nfulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the\\\\nhat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid he not advertise?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly as much as we can deduce.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom his hat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as\\\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\\\\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,\\\\nhard, and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\\\\nwas a good deal discolored. There was no maker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name; but, as Holmes\\\\nhad remarked, the initials \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cH. B.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d were scrawled upon one side. It was\\\\npierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\\\\nthe rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\\\\nplaces, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\\\\ndiscolored patches by smearing them with ink.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can see nothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, handing it back to my friend.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\\\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\\\\nwhich was characteristic of him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is perhaps less suggestive than\\\\nit might have been,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand yet there are a few inferences\\\\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\\\\nstrong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual\\\\nis of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\\\\nwell-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\\\\nevil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\\\\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\\\\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\\\\nwork upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\\\\nhas ceased to love him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued,\\\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is a man who leads a sedentary\\\\nlife, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\\\\nhas grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and\\\\nwhich he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which\\\\nare to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely\\\\nimprobable that he has gas laid on in his house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\\\\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am\\\\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\\\nintellectual?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a question\\\\nof cubic capacity,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca man with so large a brain must have\\\\nsomething in it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\\\\nin then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\\\\nso expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\\\\nhas assuredly gone down in the world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\\\\nthe moral retrogression?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is the foresight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, putting\\\\nhis finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\nare never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\\\\ncertain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\\\\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\\\\nelastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he\\\\nhas less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\\\\nweakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some\\\\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a\\\\nsign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\\\\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all\\\\nto be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the\\\\nlining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by\\\\nthe scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there\\\\nis a distinct odor of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not\\\\nthe gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the\\\\nhouse, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time;\\\\nwhile the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the\\\\nwearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the\\\\nbest of training.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you said that she had ceased to love him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\\\\nWatson, with a week\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your\\\\nwife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also\\\\nhave been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s affection.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he might be a bachelor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\\\nRemember the card upon the bird\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leg.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\\\\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that\\\\nthe individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning\\\\ntallow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94walks up-stairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and\\\\na guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains\\\\nfrom a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is very ingenious,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, laughing; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut since, as you said\\\\njust now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done, save\\\\nthe loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew\\\\nopen, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with\\\\nflushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\\\\nthe kitchen window?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get\\\\na fairer view of the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s excited face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He held out\\\\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\\\\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of\\\\nsuch purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the\\\\ndark hollow of his hand.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy Jove, Peterson!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\\\\nputty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot the Countess of Morcar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blue carbuncle!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\\\\nread the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It\\\\nis absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the\\\\nreward offered of \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the\\\\nmarket price.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The commissionaire plumped\\\\ndown into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\\\\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce the\\\\ncountess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the\\\\ngem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hotel Cosmopolitan,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\nremarked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago. John Horner,\\\\na plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has\\\\nbeen referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here,\\\\nI believe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,\\\\nuntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the\\\\nfollowing paragraph:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\\\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst. abstracted from\\\\nthe jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the\\\\nblue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his\\\\nevidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\\\\nof the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that\\\\nhe might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\\\\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\\\\naway. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\\\\nbureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\\\\nwhich, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep\\\\nher jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly\\\\ngave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\\\\ncould not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine\\\\nCusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cry of\\\\ndismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\\\\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector\\\\nBradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\\\\nstruggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\\\\nterms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\\\\nagainst the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with\\\\nthe offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown\\\\nsigns of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the\\\\nconclusion, and was carried out of court.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum! So much for the police-court,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, thoughtfully, tossing\\\\naside the paper. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence\\\\nof events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of\\\\na goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our\\\\nlittle deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\\\\ninnocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\\\\nthe goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat\\\\nand all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now\\\\nwe must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and\\\\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do\\\\nthis, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\\\\nin an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fails, I shall\\\\nhave recourse to other methods.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat will you say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Found at the\\\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker\\\\ncan have the same by applying at 6.30 this evening at 221B,\\\\nBaker Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 That is clear and concise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery. But will he see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\\\\nthe loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance\\\\nin breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson, that he\\\\nthought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly\\\\nregretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again,\\\\nthe introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one\\\\nwho knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson,\\\\nrun down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening\\\\npapers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn which, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s_, _Evening\\\\nNews_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well, sir. And this stone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson,\\\\njust buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we\\\\nmust have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\\\nfamily is now devouring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held\\\\nit against the light. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bonny thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust see how it\\\\nglints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\\\\nEvery good stone is. They are the devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pet baits. In the larger and\\\\nolder jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not\\\\nyet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\\\\nSouthern China, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\\\\ncarbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red. In spite\\\\nof its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two\\\\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\\\\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.\\\\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\\\\nand the prison? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lock it up in my strong box now, and drop a line\\\\nto the countess to say that we have it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot tell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\\\nanything to do with the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\\\\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\\\\nof considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\\\\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer\\\\nto our advertisement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you can do nothing until then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\\\\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like\\\\nto see the solution of so tangled a business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\\\\nBy-the-way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.\\\\nHudson to examine its crop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past\\\\nsix when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached\\\\nthe house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\\\\nbuttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\\\\nwas thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived, the door was opened,\\\\nand we were shown up together to Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, rising from his arm-chair, and\\\\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\\\\nreadily assume. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a\\\\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\\\\nsummer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\\\\ntime. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a\\\\nbroad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled\\\\nbrown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his\\\\nextended hand, recalled Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surmise as to his habits. His rusty\\\\nblack frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned\\\\nup, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of\\\\ncuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words\\\\nwith care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\\\\nletters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have retained these things for some days,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause we\\\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at\\\\na loss to know now why you did not advertise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShillings have not been\\\\nso plentiful with me as they once were,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had no doubt\\\\nthat the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat\\\\nand the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt\\\\nat recovering them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery naturally. By-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo eat it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so. But\\\\nI presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\\\\nsame weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, certainly, certainly;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered Mr. Baker, with a sigh of relief.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\\\\nown bird, so if you wish\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey might be useful to me as\\\\nrelics of my adventure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut beyond that I can hardly see\\\\nwhat use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\\\\nto me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\\\\nattentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\\\\nshoulders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy-the-way,\\\\nwould it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\\\\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\\\\ngoose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained\\\\nproperty under his arm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a few of us who frequent the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha\\\\nInn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 near the Museum\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94we are to be found in the Museum itself during\\\\nthe day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\\\\ninstituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\\\\nevery week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\\\\nduly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\\\\nsir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\\\\nstrode off upon his way.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, when he had closed the door\\\\nbehind him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\\\\nthe matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot particularly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up\\\\nthis clew while it is still hot.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy all means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\\\\nabout our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\\\\ncloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\\\\nlike so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly\\\\nas we swung through the Doctors\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley\\\\nStreet, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter\\\\nof an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlpha Inn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d which is a small\\\\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\\\\nHolborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered\\\\ntwo glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy geese!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The man seemed surprised.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was\\\\na member of your goose club.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not _our_ geese.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! Whose, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBreckinridge is his name.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know him. Well, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your good health, landlord, and\\\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we\\\\ncame out into the frosty air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRemember, Watson, that though we have\\\\nso homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\\\\nother a man who will certainly get seven years\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 penal servitude unless\\\\nwe can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\\\\nconfirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\\\\nwhich has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\\\\nplaced in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\\\\nthe south, then, and quick march!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\\\\nof slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\\\\nname of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man,\\\\nwith a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up\\\\nthe shutters.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-evening. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a cold night,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\nThe salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSold out of geese, I see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\\\\nslabs of marble.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet you have 500 to-morrow morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, but I was recommended to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho by?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe landlord of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, then, mister,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, with his head cocked and his arms\\\\nakimbo, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat are you driving at? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s have it straight, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\\\\nwhich you supplied to the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, I sha\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell you. So now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why you should\\\\nbe so warm over such a trifle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWarm! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When\\\\nI pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\\\\nbusiness; but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where are the geese?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Who did you sell the\\\\ngeese to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What will you take for the geese?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 One would think they\\\\nwere the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\\\\nthem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\\\\ninquiries,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, carelessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell us the bet is\\\\noff, that is all. But I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\\\\nof fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost your fiver, for it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s town bred,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped the\\\\nsalesman.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing of the kind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say it is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them\\\\never since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 were town bred.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never persuade me to believe that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you bet, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nhave a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBring me the books, Bill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\\\\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the salesman, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought that I was out\\\\nof geese, but before I finish you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll find that there is still one left\\\\nin my shop. You see this little book?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you see? Well, then,\\\\nhere on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\\\\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then!\\\\nYou see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town\\\\nsuppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94249,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d read Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere you are, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mrs. Oakshott,\\\\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, then, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the last entry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98December 22. Twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Sold to Mr. Windigate of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 at 12_s._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have you to say now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of\\\\na man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped\\\\nunder a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which\\\\nwas peculiar to him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98pink \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98un\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nhe. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dare say that if I had put \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 down in front of him, that man\\\\nwould not have given me such complete information as was drawn from\\\\nhim by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we\\\\nare, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which\\\\nremains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.\\\\nOakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is\\\\nclear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides\\\\nourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little\\\\nrat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\\\\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman,\\\\nframed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the\\\\ncringing figure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had enough of you and your geese,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wish you were\\\\nall at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your\\\\nsilly talk I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese\\\\noff you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whined the little man.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe told me to ask you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had enough\\\\nof it. Get out of this!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer\\\\nflitted away into the darkness.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome\\\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Striding\\\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\\\\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him\\\\nupon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight\\\\nthat every vestige of color had been driven from his face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho are you, then? What do you want?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, in a quavering voice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, blandly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I could not help\\\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I\\\\nthink that I could be of assistance to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\\\\npeople don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you can know nothing of this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavoring to trace some\\\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nand by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the\\\\nlittle fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn that case\\\\nwe had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept\\\\nmarket-place,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it\\\\nis that I have the pleasure of assisting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is John Robinson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nanswered, with a sidelong glance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; the real name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, sweetly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is always awkward\\\\ndoing business with an _alias_.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nhe, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy real name is James Ryder.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hotel Cosmopolitan.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Pray step\\\\ninto the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\\\\nwould wish to know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\\\\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\\\\nis on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into\\\\nthe cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\\\\nStreet. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\\\\nbreathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\\\\nhis hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere we are!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe\\\\nfire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.\\\\nPray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what\\\\nbecame of those geese?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine, in\\\\nwhich you were interested\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94white, with a black bar across the tail.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nRyder quivered with emotion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccan you tell me\\\\nwhere it went to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt came here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wonder that you\\\\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the\\\\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here\\\\nin my museum.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantel-piece with\\\\nhis right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue\\\\ncarbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\\\\nmany-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\\\\nwhether to claim or to disown it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe game\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up, Ryder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHold up, man, or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nbe into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not\\\\ngot blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of\\\\nbrandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to\\\\nbe sure!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\\\\na tinge of color into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\\\\neyes at his accuser.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\\\\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that\\\\nlittle may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had\\\\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, in a crackling\\\\nvoice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94her ladyship\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden\\\\nwealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\\\\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\\\\nyou used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\\\\npretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\\\\nbeen concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\\\\nrest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\\\\nsmall job in my lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you and your confederate Cusack\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and you\\\\nmanaged that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\\\\nrifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\\\\narrested. You then\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\\\ncompanion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, have mercy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shrieked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThink\\\\nof my father! of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went\\\\nwrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll swear it on a Bible.\\\\nOh, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bring it into court! For Christ\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet back into your chair!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, sternly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very well to\\\\ncringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\\\\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\\\\nagainst him will break down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of\\\\nthe next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\\\\ninto the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\\\\nof safety.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98HAVE MERCY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 HE SHRIEKED\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will tell you it\\\\njust as it happened, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Horner had been arrested, it\\\\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone\\\\nat once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take\\\\nit into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about\\\\nthe hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission,\\\\nand I made for my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. She had married a man named Oakshott,\\\\nand lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.\\\\nAll the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\\\\ndetective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\\\\ndown my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\\\\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\\\\nupset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\\\\nand smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell\\\\ninto talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\\\\nthey stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\\\\nthings about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\\\\nhe lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to\\\\nturn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought\\\\nof the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might\\\\nat any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone\\\\nin my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time,\\\\nand looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\\\\nsuddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\\\\nbest detective that ever lived.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\\\\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as\\\\ngood as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry\\\\nmy stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind\\\\nthis I drove one of the birds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a fine big one, white, with a barred\\\\ntail. I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down\\\\nits throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I\\\\nfelt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the\\\\ncreature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what\\\\nwas the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and\\\\nfluttered off among the others.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says she.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you said you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\\\nfeeling which was the fattest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve set yours aside for you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Jem\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bird, we call\\\\nit. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the big white one over yonder. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twenty-six of them,\\\\nwhich makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Thank you, Maggie,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but if it is all the same to you, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\nrather have that one I was handling just now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The other is a good three pound heavier,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and we fattened\\\\nit expressly for you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Never mind. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have the other, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take it now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, just as you like,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, a little huffed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Which is it you\\\\nwant, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\\\\nflock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\\\\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that\\\\nit was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked,\\\\nand we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for\\\\nthere was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\\\\nhad occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and hurried\\\\ninto the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where are they all, Maggie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Gone to the dealer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, Jem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Which dealer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But was there another with a barred tail?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98the same as the\\\\none I chose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell\\\\nthem apart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\\\\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at\\\\nonce, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You\\\\nheard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like\\\\nthat. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I\\\\nam myself. And now\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\\\\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!\\\\nGod help me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\\\\nhis hands.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by\\\\nthe measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s finger-tips upon the edge of\\\\nthe table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat, sir! Oh, heaven bless you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo more words. Get out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\\\\nfrom the street.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter all, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\\\npipe, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\\\\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am\\\\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\\\\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\\\\nSend him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life. Besides,\\\\nit is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most\\\\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.\\\\nIf you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will\\\\nbegin another investigation, in which, also, a bird will be the chief\\\\nfeature.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure VIII\\\\n\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\\\\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\\\\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\\\\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\\\\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\\\\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\\\\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\\\\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\\\\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\\\\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It\\\\nis possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\\\\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\\\\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\\\\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\\\\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are wide-spread\\\\nrumors as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\\\\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\\\\n\\\\nIt was early in April in the year \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9983 that I woke one morning to find\\\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\\\\na late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed\\\\nme that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some\\\\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\\\\nregular in my habits.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the common lot\\\\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\\\\nand I on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it, then\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a fire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in\\\\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis\\\\nat this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their\\\\nbeds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\\\\nshould call you and give you the chance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\\\\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he\\\\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\\\\nmy clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\\\\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\\\\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-morning, madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, cheerily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Sherlock\\\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\\\\nthat Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\\\\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\\\\nyou are shivering.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the woman, in a low voice,\\\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She raised her veil as she\\\\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\\\\nagitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes,\\\\nlike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\\\\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her\\\\nexpression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\\\\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must not fear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting\\\\nher forearm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\\\\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know me, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\\\\nyour left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\\\\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my\\\\ncompanion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe left arm\\\\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\\\\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\\\\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\\\\nside of the driver.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\\\\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\\\\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94none,\\\\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\\\\naid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\\\\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\\\\nher that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\\\\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\\\\ndarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\\\\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\\\\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not\\\\nfind me ungrateful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes turned to his desk, and unlocking it, drew out a small\\\\ncase-book, which he consulted.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFarintosh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\\\\nan opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\\\\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as\\\\nI did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\\\\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\\\\nto, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\\\\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\\\\nmatter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied our visitor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe very horror of my situation lies\\\\nin the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\\\\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\\\\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\\\\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\\\\nnervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\\\\nanswers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\\\\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\\\\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am all attention, madam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my step-father, who is\\\\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\\\\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes nodded his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe name is familiar to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\\\\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\\\\nHampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\\\\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family\\\\nruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the\\\\nRegency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\\\\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\\\\nmortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living\\\\nthe horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\\\\nstep-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\\\\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\\\\nmedical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\\\\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice.\\\\nIn a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\\\\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and\\\\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long\\\\nterm of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to England a morose and\\\\ndisappointed man.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\\\nyoung widow of Major-general Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\\\\nmy mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94not less\\\\nthan \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 a year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\\\\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\\\\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\\\\nafter our return to England my mother died\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94she was killed eight years\\\\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\\\\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to\\\\nlive with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money\\\\nwhich my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed\\\\nto be no obstacle to our happiness.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.\\\\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who\\\\nhad at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\\\\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came\\\\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\\\\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\\\\nthe men of the family, and in my step-father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s case it had, I believe,\\\\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\\\\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\\\\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks\\\\nwould fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\\\\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\\\\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no\\\\nfriends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these\\\\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\\\\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\\\\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\\\\nweeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\\\\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\\\\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the\\\\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a\\\\nlong time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the\\\\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\\\\nas mine has.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour sister is dead, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\\\\nspeak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have\\\\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\\\\nposition. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s maiden sister, Miss\\\\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\\\\nallowed to pay short visits at this lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. Julia went there at\\\\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines,\\\\nto whom she became engaged. My step-father learned of the engagement\\\\nwhen my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but\\\\nwithin a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\\\\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\\\\nglanced across at his visitor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray be precise as to details,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\\\\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\\\\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are\\\\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\\\\nthe buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, the second\\\\nmy sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and the third my own. There is no communication between\\\\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself\\\\nplain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerfectly so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal\\\\nnight Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\\\\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of\\\\nthe strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left\\\\nher room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\\\\nchatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock she rose to\\\\nleave me but she paused at the door and looked back.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell me, Helen,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98have you ever heard any one whistle in\\\\nthe dead of the night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Never,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\\\\nsleep?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Certainly not. But why?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in\\\\nthe morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it\\\\nhas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94perhaps from the\\\\nnext room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\\\\nwhether you had heard it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\\\\nnot hear it also.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 She smiled back at\\\\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\\\\nlock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in\\\\nat night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlways.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a\\\\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\\\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\\\\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\\\\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\\\\nwoman. I knew that it was my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. I sprang from my bed,\\\\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\\\\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\\\\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\\\\nAs I ran down the passage, my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door was unlocked, and revolved\\\\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\\\\nwhat was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\\\\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\\\\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\\\\nof a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\\\\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\\\\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I\\\\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\\\\nforget, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There\\\\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\\\\nher finger into the air in the direction of the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room, but a\\\\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\\\\nloudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his\\\\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side she was unconscious,\\\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\\\\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\\\\ndied without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\\\\nend of my beloved sister.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne moment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9care you sure about this whistle and\\\\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\\\\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\\\\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas your sister dressed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\\\\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\\\\nalarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\\\\ncoroner come to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s conduct\\\\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\\\\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had\\\\nbeen fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\\\\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\\\\nnight. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\\\\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\\\\nthe same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\\\\nstaples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\\\\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow about poison?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\\\\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere there gypsies in the plantation at the time?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there are nearly always some there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a speckled\\\\nband?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\\\nthese very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\\\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese are very deep waters,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpray go on with your narrative.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\\\\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\\\\nknown for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.\\\\nHis name is Armitage\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Percy Armitage\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the second son of Mr. Armitage,\\\\nof Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition\\\\nto the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two\\\\ndays ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,\\\\nand my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into\\\\nthe chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in\\\\nwhich she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,\\\\nas I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in\\\\nthe silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of\\\\nher own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be\\\\nseen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I\\\\ndressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart\\\\nat the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Crown Inn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from\\\\nwhence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you\\\\nand asking your advice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have done wisely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my friend. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut have you told me all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-father.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, what do you mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\\\nhand that lay upon our visitor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knee. Five little livid spots, the\\\\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have been cruelly used,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\nThe lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is a\\\\nhard man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\\\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a very deep business,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a thousand\\\\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\\\\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\\\\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\\\\nwithout the knowledge of your step-father?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\\\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\\\\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper\\\\nnow, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the\\\\nway.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy no means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\\\\ntown. But I shall return by the twelve o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock train, so as to be there\\\\nin time for your coming.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided\\\\nmy trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\\\\nafternoon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\\\\nfrom the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Sherlock Holmes,\\\\nleaning back in his chair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDark enough and sinister enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\\\\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\\\\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\\\\nend.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot think.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\\\\nband of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\\\\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\\\\ninterest in preventing his step-daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marriage, the dying allusion\\\\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\\\\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\\\\nwhich secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that\\\\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\\\\nthose lines.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what, then, did the gypsies do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see many objections to any such theory.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\\\\nStoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\\\\nor if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\\\\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\\\\nhis hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar\\\\nof the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\\\\nside. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\\\\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\\\\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\\\\nof prey.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich of you is Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked this apparition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my companion,\\\\nquietly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, blandly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take a seat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do nothing of the kind. My step-daughter has been here. I have\\\\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat has she been saying to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d screamed the old man, furiously.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued my\\\\ncompanion, imperturbably.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! You put me off, do you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our new visitor, taking a step\\\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know you, you scoundrel! I\\\\nhave heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMy friend smiled.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes, the busybody!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHis smile broadened.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour conversation is most entertaining,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\\\ndraught.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will go when I have said my say. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare to meddle with my\\\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He stepped swiftly forward,\\\\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snarled, and hurling\\\\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe seems a very amiable person,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am not\\\\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As he spoke he picked up\\\\nthe steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\\\\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\\\\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,\\\\nwe shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\\\\nmatter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nIt was nearly one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\\\\nwith notes and figures.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo determine\\\\nits exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices\\\\nof the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which\\\\nat the time of the wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death was little short of \\\\xc2\\\\xa31100, is now,\\\\nthrough the fall in agricultural prices, not more than \\\\xc2\\\\xa3750. Each\\\\ndaughter can claim an income of \\\\xc2\\\\xa3250, in case of marriage. It is\\\\nevident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would\\\\nhave had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to\\\\na very serious extent. My morning\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work has not been wasted, since it\\\\nhas proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the\\\\nway of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\\\\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\\\\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\\\\ndrive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s No. 2 is an excellent argument\\\\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\\\\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\\\\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five\\\\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with\\\\na bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\\\\nway-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and\\\\nthe air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at\\\\nleast there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the\\\\nspring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion\\\\nsat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over\\\\nhis eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest\\\\nthought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and\\\\npointed over the meadows.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\nA heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\\\\na grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\\\\nthe gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStoke Moran?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked the\\\\ndriver.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is some building going on there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat is where we\\\\nare going.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the village,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\\\\nsome distance to the left; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut if you want to get to the house, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over\\\\nthe fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Holmes, shading his\\\\neyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\\\\nLeatherhead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought it as well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat\\\\nthis fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\\\\ndefinite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.\\\\nYou see that we have been as good as our word.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\\\\nwhich spoke her joy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she\\\\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll has turned out splendidly.\\\\nDr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\\\\nbefore evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have had the pleasure of making the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s acquaintance,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9che has followed me, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo it appears.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\\\\nhe say when he returns?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more\\\\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\\\\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at\\\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\\\\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\\\\nportion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out\\\\non each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken, and\\\\nblocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a\\\\npicture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but\\\\nthe right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\\\\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\\\\nthis was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\\\\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep\\\\nattention the outsides of the windows.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\\\ncentre one to your sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and the one next to the main building to\\\\nDr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chamber?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPending the alterations, as I understand. By-the-way, there does not\\\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\\\nroom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\\\\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\\\\nin it, of course?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any one to pass through.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\\\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\\\\nand bar your shutters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through\\\\nthe open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,\\\\nbut without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\\\\npassed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\\\\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy theory certainly\\\\npresents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\\\\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\\\\nmatter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\\\\nthree bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,\\\\nso we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\\\\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\\\\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\\\\nthe fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood\\\\nin one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\\\\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\\\\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\\\nroom, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards\\\\nround and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so\\\\nold and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of\\\\nthe house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\\\\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere does that bell communicate with?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, at last, pointing to\\\\na thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\\\\nlying upon the pillow.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt goes to the house-keeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt looks newer than the other things?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\\\\nwanted for ourselves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\\\\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\\\\nfloor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,\\\\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\\\\nbetween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\\\\nthe chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent\\\\nsome time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the\\\\nwall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a dummy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it ring?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\\\\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\\\\nopening for the ventilator is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery strange!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are one or\\\\ntwo very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\\\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\\\\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is also quite modern,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the lady.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94dummy\\\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\\\\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\\\\ninner apartment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chamber was larger than that of his\\\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\\\\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair\\\\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\\\\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\\\\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\\\\nkeenest interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, tapping the safe.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy step-father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business papers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh! you have seen inside, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a cat in it, for example?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. What a strange idea!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, look at this!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\\\\nthe top of it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\\\\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare\\\\nsay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He squatted\\\\ndown in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the\\\\ngreatest attention.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. That is quite settled,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, rising and putting his\\\\nlens in his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello! Here is something interesting!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one\\\\ncorner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied\\\\nso as to make a loop of whip-cord.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a common enough lash. But I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why it should be tied.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a wicked world,\\\\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of\\\\nall. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\\\\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI had never seen my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face so grim or his brow so dark as it\\\\nwas when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\\\\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\\\\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\\\\nreverie.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you should\\\\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall most certainly do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\\\\nupon your compliance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assure you that I am in your hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\\\nroom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\\\\ninn over there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, that is the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Crown.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\\\\nwhen your step-father comes back. Then when you hear him retire for\\\\nthe night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp,\\\\nput your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\\\\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\\\\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\\\\nthere for one night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, easily.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what will you do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleeve.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps I have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen for pity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\\\ndied from some sudden fright.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.\\\\nRoylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,\\\\nand be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest\\\\nassured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\\\\nsitting-room at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrown Inn.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They were on the upper floor, and\\\\nfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\\\\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\\\\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\\\\nof the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\\\\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nvoice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\\\\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\\\\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering\\\\ndarkness, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\\\\nis a distinct element of danger.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan I be of assistance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour presence might be invaluable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall certainly come.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very kind of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\\\nwas visible to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\\\\nyou saw all that I did.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\\\\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou saw the ventilator, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have\\\\na small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\\\\nhardly pass through.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\\\nMoran.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\\\ncould smell Dr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\\\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\\\\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ninquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what harm can there be in that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\\\\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\\\\nnot that strike you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot as yet see any connection.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\\\nbefore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot say that I have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\\\\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for so we may call\\\\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\\\\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is\\\\nthe first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\\\\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\\\\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\\\\ndeeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\\\\nover; for goodness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds\\\\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nAbout nine o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\\\\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single\\\\nbright light shone out right in front of us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is our signal,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit comes\\\\nfrom the middle window.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\\\\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\\\\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\\\\nsombre errand.\\\\n\\\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\\\\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees,\\\\nwe reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\\\\nwindow, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\\\\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\\\\nwith writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\\\\ndarkness.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I whispered; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdid you see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh, and put\\\\nhis lips to my ear.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a nice household,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is the baboon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was\\\\na cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\\\\nmoment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\\\\nHolmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\\\\nbedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\\\\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\\\\nseen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\\\\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\\\\nI could do to distinguish the words:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI nodded again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\\\\nyou in that chair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\\\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\\\\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\\\n\\\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\\\\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion\\\\nsat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\\\\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray\\\\nof light, and we waited in absolute darkness. From outside came the\\\\noccasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long\\\\ndrawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at\\\\nliberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,\\\\nwhich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat\\\\nwaiting silently for whatever might befall.\\\\n\\\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\\\\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by\\\\na strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some one in the next\\\\nroom had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and\\\\nthen all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half\\\\nan hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\\\\naudible\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\\\\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\\\\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\\\\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see it, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he yelled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard\\\\na low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\\\\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\\\\nso savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and\\\\nfilled with horror and loathing.\\\\n\\\\nHe had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when\\\\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible\\\\ncry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a\\\\nhoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful\\\\nshriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant\\\\nparsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the\\\\nlast echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can it mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I gasped.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt means that it is all over,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd perhaps, after\\\\nall, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\\\nRoylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\\\\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.\\\\nThen he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\\\\npistol in my hand.\\\\n\\\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\\\\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam\\\\nof light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\\\\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long\\\\ngray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\\\\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\\\\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\\\\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare\\\\nat the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\\\\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\\\\nhis head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe band! the speckled band!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Holmes.\\\\n\\\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began\\\\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\\\\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a swamp adder!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe deadliest snake in India. He\\\\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\\\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\\\\ndigs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and\\\\nwe can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the\\\\ncounty police know what has happened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap, and\\\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck, he drew it from its horrid\\\\nperch, and carrying it at arm\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\\\nalready run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news\\\\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\\\\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\\\\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\\\\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\\\\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\\\\nback next day.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which\\\\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the\\\\nword \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98band,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the\\\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\\\\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\\\\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\\\\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened\\\\nan occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the\\\\ndoor. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to\\\\nyou, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the\\\\nbed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped\\\\nto the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\\\nthere as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming\\\\nto the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when\\\\nI coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a\\\\nsupply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right\\\\ntrack. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\\\\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\\\\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\\\\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\\\\nof view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\\\\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\\\\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\\\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\\\\nthe victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which\\\\nwe saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\\\\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\\\\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\\\\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.\\\\nAn inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\\\\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\\\\nshould reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\\\\nand the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts\\\\nwhich may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\\\\nobviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his\\\\nsafe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know\\\\nthe steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I\\\\nheard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I\\\\ninstantly lit the light and attacked it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\\\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its\\\\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this\\\\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\\\\nconscience.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure IX\\\\n\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S THUMB\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr. Sherlock\\\\nHolmes for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only\\\\ntwo which I was the means of introducing to his notice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that of Mr.\\\\nHatherley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s madness. Of these\\\\nthe latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original\\\\nobserver, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic\\\\nin its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon\\\\nrecord, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive\\\\nmethods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The\\\\nstory has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,\\\\nlike all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set\\\\nforth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts\\\\nslowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually\\\\naway as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the\\\\ncomplete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression\\\\nupon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the\\\\neffect.\\\\n\\\\nIt was in the summer of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9989, not long after my marriage, that the\\\\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarize. I had returned to\\\\ncivil practice, and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\\\\nrooms, although I continually visited him, and occasionally even\\\\npersuaded him to forego his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\\\\nus. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at\\\\nno very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients\\\\nfrom among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful\\\\nand lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues, and\\\\nof endeavoring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\\\\ninfluence.\\\\n\\\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, I was awakened by\\\\nthe maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come\\\\nfrom Paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed\\\\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\\\\ntrivial, and hastened down-stairs. As I descended, my old ally, the\\\\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got him here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9che\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\\\\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a new patient,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bring him round\\\\nmyself; then he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I\\\\nmust go now, doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And off\\\\nhe went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\\\\n\\\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the\\\\ntable. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft\\\\ncloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his\\\\nhands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with\\\\nblood-stains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should\\\\nsay, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and\\\\ngave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong\\\\nagitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I have\\\\nhad a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\\\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\\\\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a\\\\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI took it up and glanced at it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3d floor).\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d That was the name,\\\\nstyle, and abode of my morning visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI regret that I have kept you\\\\nwaiting,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are fresh\\\\nfrom a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\\\\noccupation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, and laughed. He\\\\nlaughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his\\\\nchair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against\\\\nthat laugh.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpull yourself together!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and I poured out some\\\\nwater from a caraffe.\\\\n\\\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\\\\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\\\\nover and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\\\\nblushing hotly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been making a fool of myself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. Drink this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\\\\ncolor began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly\\\\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my\\\\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding\\\\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\\\\nbeen. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled\\\\nconsiderably.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\\\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was\\\\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly\\\\nround the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\\\nprovince.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis has been done,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, examining the wound, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cby a very heavy and\\\\nsharp instrument.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA thing like a cleaver,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn accident, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy no means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! a murderous attack?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery murderous indeed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou horrify me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\\\\nover with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. He lay back without\\\\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow is that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, when I had finished.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\\\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\\\\nto your nerves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\\\\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement; for\\\\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\\\\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clews which\\\\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\\\\nbe done.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\\\\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\\\nfriend Mr. Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered my visitor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I should\\\\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\\\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\\\\nhim?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do better. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take you round to him myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be immensely obliged to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a\\\\nlittle breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\\\ninstant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I rushed up-stairs, explained the matter shortly to my\\\\nwife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new\\\\nacquaintance to Baker Street.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in\\\\nhis dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_, and smoking\\\\nhis before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and\\\\ndottels left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried\\\\nand collected on the corner of the mantel-piece. He received us in his\\\\nquietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us\\\\nin a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\\\\nbrandy-and-water within his reach.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\\\nHatherley,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely\\\\nat home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up\\\\nyour strength with a little stimulant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my patient, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I have felt another man since the\\\\ndoctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\\\\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\\\\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes sat in his big arm-chair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,\\\\nand we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\\\\ndetailed to us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am an hydraulic engineer,\\\\nand I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\\\\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known\\\\nfirm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having\\\\nalso come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death,\\\\nI determined to start in business for myself, and took professional\\\\nchambers in Victoria Street.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose that every one finds his first independent start in business\\\\na dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two\\\\nyears I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is\\\\nabsolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings\\\\namount to \\\\xc2\\\\xa327 10_s._ Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\\\\nthe afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began\\\\nto sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at\\\\nall.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office,\\\\nmy clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to\\\\nsee me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Colonel Lysander Stark\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the\\\\ncolonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding\\\\nthinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole\\\\nface sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks\\\\nwas drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation\\\\nseemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\\\\nbright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but\\\\nneatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\\\\nthirty.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr. Hatherley?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, with something of a German accent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You\\\\nhave been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not\\\\nonly proficient in his profession, but is also discreet and capable of\\\\npreserving a secret.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\\\\naddress. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at\\\\nthis moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\\\\nand a bachelor, and are residing alone in London.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That is quite correct,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but you will excuse me if\\\\nI say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\\\\nqualifications. I understood that it was on a professional matter that\\\\nyou wished to speak to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the\\\\npoint. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy\\\\nis quite essential\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94_absolute_ secrecy, you understand, and of course\\\\nwe may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives\\\\nin the bosom of his family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98If I promise to keep a secret,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you may absolutely depend\\\\nupon my doing so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\\\\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Do you promise, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, at last.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, I promise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference\\\\nto the matter at all, either in word or writing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have already given you my word.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across\\\\nthe room, he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, coming back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I know that clerks are\\\\nsometimes curious as to their master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s affairs. Now we can talk in\\\\nsafety.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He drew up his chair very close to mine, and began to stare at\\\\nme again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to\\\\nrise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even\\\\nmy dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my\\\\nimpatience.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I beg that you will state your business, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98my time is of\\\\nvalue.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to\\\\nmy lips.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98How would fifty guineas for a night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work suit you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Most admirably.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I say a night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work, but an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s would be nearer the mark. I\\\\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has\\\\ngot out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\\\\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of\\\\nOxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from\\\\nPaddington which would bring you there at about 11.15.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There is a drive, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven\\\\nmiles from Eyford Station.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would\\\\nbe no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense\\\\nyou for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\\\\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of\\\\nyour profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of\\\\nthe business, there is plenty of time to do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be\\\\nto me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Not at all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall be very happy to accommodate\\\\nmyself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little\\\\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have\\\\nexacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to\\\\ncommit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\\\\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Entirely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\\\nfuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one\\\\nor two places in England?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have heard so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Some little time ago I bought a small place\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a very small\\\\nplace\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover\\\\nthat there was a deposit of fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth in one of my fields. On\\\\nexamining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively\\\\nsmall one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones\\\\nupon the right and left\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94both of them, however, in the grounds of my\\\\nneighbors. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land\\\\ncontained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally,\\\\nit was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true\\\\nvalue; but, unfortunately, I had no capital by which I could do this. I\\\\ntook a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested\\\\nthat we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and\\\\nthat in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy\\\\nthe neighboring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and\\\\nin order to help us in our operations we erected an hydraulic press.\\\\nThis press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we\\\\nwish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,\\\\nhowever, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers\\\\ncoming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if\\\\nthe facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\\\\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise\\\\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford\\\\nto-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I quite follow you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The only point which I could not\\\\nquite understand, was what use you could make of an hydraulic press\\\\nin excavating fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like\\\\ngravel from a pit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, carelessly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we have our own process. We compress\\\\nthe earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what\\\\nthey are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my\\\\nconfidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nHe rose as he spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11.15.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall certainly be there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And not a word to a soul.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He looked at me with a last, long,\\\\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he\\\\nhurried from the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the\\\\nfee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\\\\nupon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead\\\\nto other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron\\\\nhad made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that\\\\nhis explanation of the fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth was sufficient to explain the\\\\nnecessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\\\\nshould tell any one of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\\\\nwinds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\\\\nhaving obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98NOT A WORD TO A SOUL\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage, but my station.\\\\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\\\\nlittle dim-lit station after eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. I was the only passenger\\\\nwho got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\\\\nsleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,\\\\nhowever, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\\\\nupon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\\\\ninto a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the\\\\nwindows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\\\\nfast as the horse could go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne horse?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d interjected Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, only one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you observe the color?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\\\\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTired-looking or fresh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, fresh and glossy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\\\ninteresting statement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\\\\nthe rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that\\\\nit must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\\\\ntime, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\\\\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\\\\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\\\\njolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\\\\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\\\\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\\\\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey,\\\\nbut the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation\\\\nsoon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged\\\\nfor the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to\\\\na stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after\\\\nhim, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We\\\\nstepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so\\\\nthat I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the\\\\nhouse. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\\\\nheavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the\\\\ncarriage drove away.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\\\nlooking for matches, and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\\\\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\\\\nshot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with\\\\na lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\\\\nforward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\\\\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that\\\\nit was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\\\\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\\\\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\\\\nher hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\\\\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\\\nminutes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\\\\nplainly-furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\\\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\\\\non the top of a harmonium beside the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall not keep you\\\\nwaiting an instant,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance\\\\nof German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\\\\nothers being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\\\\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\\\\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\\\\nsilent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\\\\npassage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\\\\nuneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\\\\nwhat were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?\\\\nAnd where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was\\\\nall I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.\\\\nFor that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within\\\\nthat radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it\\\\nwas quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\\\\nto keep up my spirits, and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\\\\nfifty-guinea fee.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\\\\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\\\\nstanding in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\\\\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\\\\ncould see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\\\\nchill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\\\\nsilent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\\\\neyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\\\\nbehind her.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I would go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\\\\ncalmly; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\\\\nto do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But, madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\\\\npossibly leave until I have seen the machine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is not worth your while to wait,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You can pass\\\\nthrough the door; no one hinders.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 And then, seeing that I smiled and\\\\nshook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\\\\nforward, with her hands wrung together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98For the love of Heaven!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she\\\\nwhispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98get away from here before it is too late!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\\\\nin an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\\\\nfifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\\\\nwhich seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\\\\nI slink away without having carried out my commission, and without\\\\nthe payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\\\\nmonomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\\\\nshaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head, and\\\\ndeclared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\\\\nher entreaties, when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\\\\nfootsteps were heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,\\\\nthrew up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly\\\\nand as noiselessly as she had come.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe new-comers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short, thick man with\\\\na chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who\\\\nwas introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is my secretary and manager,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said the colonel. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98By-the-way, I\\\\nwas under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear\\\\nthat you have felt the draught.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98On the contrary,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I opened the door myself, because I felt\\\\nthe room to be a little close.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Perhaps we had better\\\\nproceed to business, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr. Ferguson and I will take you\\\\nup to see the machine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh no, it is in the house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What, you dig fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth in the house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All\\\\nwe wish you to do is to examine the machine, and to let us know what is\\\\nwrong with it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe went up-stairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\\\\nmanager, and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\\\\ncorridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\\\\nthe thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\\\\ncrossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture\\\\nabove the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls,\\\\nand the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried\\\\nto put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten\\\\nthe warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a\\\\nkeen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and\\\\nsilent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at\\\\nleast a fellow-countryman.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\\\\ncould hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\\\\ncolonel ushered me in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98We are now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98actually within the hydraulic press, and it\\\\nwould be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if any one were to\\\\nturn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\\\\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\\\\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\\\\nwhich receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\\\\nmanner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\\\\nthere is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\\\\nof its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\\\\nshow us how we can set it right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\\\\nIt was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\\\\npressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\\\\nwhich controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\\\\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\\\\none of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\\\\nindia-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\\\\nso as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\\\\nclearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\\\\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several\\\\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\\\\nI had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\\\\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\\\\nobvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth was the merest\\\\nfabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\\\\nto examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\\\\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when I\\\\nheard a muttered exclamation in German, and saw the cadaverous face of\\\\nthe colonel looking down at me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What are you doing there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\\\\nwhich he had told me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I was admiring your fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\nthink that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\\\\nI knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\\\\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray\\\\neyes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you shall know all about the machine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He took\\\\na step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\\\\nlock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\\\\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hello!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nI yelled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hello! Colonel! Let me out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\\\\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\\\\nleaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\\\\nupon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\\\\nlight I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\\\\njerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which\\\\nmust within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\\\\nscreaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\\\\nimplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\\\\nlevers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\\\\nhead, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\\\\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face\\\\nthe weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\\\\ndreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\\\\nto lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\\\\nAlready I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\\\\nbrought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\\\\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin\\\\nline of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\\\\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\\\\nhardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\\\\nThe next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\\\\nother side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\\\\nlamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\\\\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\\\\nfound myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\\\\nwoman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\\\\na candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\\\\nso foolishly rejected.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Come! come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she cried, breathlessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98They will be here in a moment.\\\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\\\\ntime, but come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\\\\nfeet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\\\\nlatter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we\\\\nheard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one\\\\nanswering the other, from the floor on which we were and from the one\\\\nbeneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her\\\\nwits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through\\\\nthe window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is your only chance,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is high, but it may be that\\\\nyou can jump it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\\\\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\\\\nforward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ncleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\\\\nwindow, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\\\\nlooked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\\\\ndown. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\\\\nshould have heard what passed between my savior and the ruffian who\\\\npursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\\\\ngo back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\\\\nmind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\\\\nher arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Fritz! Fritz!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she cried, in English, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98remember your promise after\\\\nthe last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,\\\\nhe will be silent!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You are mad, Elise!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nHe dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\\\\nhis heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\\\\nthe sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\\\\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\\\\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\\\\nthat I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\\\\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at\\\\nmy hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time,\\\\nsaw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from\\\\nmy wound. I endeavored to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came\\\\na sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint\\\\namong the rose-bushes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been\\\\na very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\\\\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\\\\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.\\\\nThe smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my\\\\nnight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I\\\\nmight hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But, to my astonishment,\\\\nwhen I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.\\\\nI had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road, and\\\\njust a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my\\\\napproaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the\\\\nprevious night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that\\\\nhad passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter\\\\nwas on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of\\\\nhim whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\\\\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\\\\none about three miles off.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\\\\nwait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\\\\nwas a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\\\\ndressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\\\\nput the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after, listening to this\\\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\\\\nshelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\\\\ncuttings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Lost,\\\\non the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, an hydraulic\\\\nengineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock at night, and has not been\\\\nheard of since. Was dressed in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\\\\nlast time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\\\nfancy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried my patient. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that explains what the girl\\\\nsaid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\\\\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\\\\nin the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\\\\nleave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\\\\nprecious, so if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to Scotland Yard\\\\nat once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\\\\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\\\\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\\\\na plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance\\\\nmap of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses\\\\ndrawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere you are,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten\\\\nmiles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\\\\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s good drive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\\\\nunconscious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat I cannot understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis why they should have spared you\\\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\\\\nwas softened by the woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s entreaties.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\\\\nlife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Bradstreet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have\\\\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\\\\nthat we are in search of are to be found.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I could lay my finger on it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally, now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the inspector, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have formed your opinion!\\\\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\\\\ncountry is more deserted there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I say east,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my patient.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am for west,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked the plain-clothes man. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are several\\\\nquiet little villages up there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I am for north,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause there are no hills there, and\\\\nour friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the inspector, laughing; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a very pretty diversity\\\\nof opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\\\\ncasting vote to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are all wrong.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t _all_ be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, you can. This is my point;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he placed his finger in the centre\\\\nof the circle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is where we shall find them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the twelve-mile drive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped Hatherley.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\\\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\\\\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Bradstreet,\\\\nthoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this\\\\ngang.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone at all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are coiners on a large scale, and\\\\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\\\\nsilver.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\ninspector. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We\\\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\\\\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\\\\nhands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\\\\nthem right enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\\\\nto fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\\\\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\\\\nclump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich\\\\nfeather over the landscape.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA house on fire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on\\\\nits way.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the station-master.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen did it break out?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\\\\nthe whole place is in a blaze.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhose house is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDr. Becher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTell me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d broke in the engineer, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\\\\nwith a long, sharp nose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\\\nEnglishman, and there isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\\\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as\\\\nI understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\\\\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\\\\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill,\\\\nand there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us,\\\\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\\\\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is the\\\\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\\\\nwindow is the one that I jumped from.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, at least,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have had your revenge upon them.\\\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\\\\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\\\\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\\\\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAnd Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no\\\\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\\\\nGerman, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\\\\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\\\\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\\\\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ingenuity failed ever to\\\\ndiscover the least clew as to their whereabouts.\\\\n\\\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\\\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\\\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\\\\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\\\\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\\\\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\\\\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\\\\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\\\\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\\\nbeen already referred to.\\\\n\\\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\\\\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\\\\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\\\\ntale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\\\\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\\\\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\\\\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\\\\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once\\\\nmore to London, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\\\\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExperience,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndirectly it may be of value,\\\\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure X\\\\n\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\\\\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\\\\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it,\\\\nand their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\\\\nfour-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the\\\\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\\\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\\\\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\\\n\\\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\\\\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.\\\\nI had remained in-doors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden\\\\nturn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I\\\\nhad brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign,\\\\nthrobbed with dull persistency. With my body in one easy-chair and my\\\\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers,\\\\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\\\nenvelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s noble\\\\ncorrespondent could be.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, as he entered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour\\\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\\\ntide-waiter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nanswered, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\\\\na man either to be bored or to lie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot social, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, distinctly professional.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd from a noble client?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of the highest in England.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\\\\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\\\\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\\\\nnew investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\\\\nhave you not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt looks like it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\\\\ncorner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have had nothing else to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is\\\\nalways instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\\\\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, with the deepest interest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\\\\nSimon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these\\\\npapers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he\\\\nsays:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Lord Backwater tells me that I\\\\n  may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.\\\\n  I have determined, therefore, to call upon you, and to consult\\\\n  you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred\\\\n  in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,\\\\n  is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees\\\\n  no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that\\\\n  it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in\\\\n  the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at\\\\n  that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is\\\\n  of paramount importance.    Yours faithfully,   ST. SIMON.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer\\\\nside of his right little finger,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, as he folded up the\\\\nepistle.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe says four o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\\\nsubject. Turn over those papers, and arrange the extracts in their\\\\norder of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He\\\\npicked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside\\\\nthe mantel-piece. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere he is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, sitting down and flattening it\\\\nout upon his knee. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second\\\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Hum! Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief\\\\nover a fess sable. Born in 1846. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forty-one years of age, which\\\\nis mature for marriage. Was Undersecretary for the Colonies in a late\\\\nAdministration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and\\\\nTudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive\\\\nin all this. I think that I must turn to you, Watson, for something\\\\nmore solid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor\\\\nthe facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry\\\\non hand, and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture\\\\nvan. That is quite cleared up now\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94though, indeed, it was obvious from\\\\nthe first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\\\\ncolumn of _The Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A marriage has been arranged,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it says, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and will, if rumor is\\\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second\\\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of\\\\nAloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 That is all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTerse and to the point,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin\\\\nlegs towards the fire.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers\\\\nof the same week. Ah, here it is. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There will soon be a call for\\\\nprotection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle\\\\nappears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the\\\\nmanagement of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the\\\\nhands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important\\\\naddition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes\\\\nwhich have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\\\\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\\\ngod\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\\\\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\\\\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an\\\\nonly child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\\\\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.\\\\nAs it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled\\\\nto sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon\\\\nhas no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmoor, it\\\\nis obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\\\\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\\\\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnything else?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, yawning.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes; plenty. Then there is another note in _The Morning Post_ to\\\\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\\\\nbe at St. George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\\\\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\\\\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\\\\nDoran. Two days later\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is, on Wednesday last\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94there is a curt\\\\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honey-moon\\\\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place, near Petersfield. Those are\\\\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBefore the what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, with a start.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe vanishing of the lady.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen did she vanish, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt the wedding breakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\\\ndramatic, in fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\\\nhoney-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\\\\nPray let me have the details.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps we may make them less so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Singular\\\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the\\\\ngreatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have\\\\ntaken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\\\\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\\\\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\\\\nrumors which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of\\\\nthe attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public\\\\nattention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served\\\\nby affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, Hanover Square,\\\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\\\\nbride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\\\\nLord Eustace, and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister\\\\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party\\\\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\\\\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little\\\\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained,\\\\nwho endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\\\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after\\\\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\\\\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\\\\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room.\\\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\\\\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\\\\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to\\\\nthe passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave\\\\nthe house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\\\\nmistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that\\\\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with\\\\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\\\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\\\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to\\\\nthe whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumors of foul play in\\\\nthe matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of\\\\nthe woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that,\\\\nfrom jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\\\\nstrange disappearance of the bride.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd is that all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\\\nsuggestive one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it is\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\\\\nat the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Allegro,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\\\\nnow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\\\\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\\\\nwill prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\\\\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord Robert St. Simon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\\\\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and\\\\nwith the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had\\\\never been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet\\\\nhis general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a\\\\nslight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His\\\\nhair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled\\\\nround the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful\\\\nto the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored\\\\ngaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\\\\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\\\\neye-glasses.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take\\\\nthe basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up\\\\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have\\\\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\\\\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I am descending.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI beg pardon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy last client of the sort was a king.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe King of Scandinavia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, suavely, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I extend to the\\\\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\\\nyours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course! Very right! very right! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\\\nforming an opinion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94this article,\\\\nfor example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before any one could offer\\\\nan opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\\\\nquestioning you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou were travelling in the States?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you become engaged then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you were on a friendly footing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHer father is very rich?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how did he make his money?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\\\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94your wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ncharacter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\\\\nfire. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy wife was twenty before her\\\\nfather became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining\\\\ncamp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education\\\\nhas come from Nature rather than from the school-master. She is what\\\\nwe call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free,\\\\nunfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94volcanic, I\\\\nwas about to say. She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless\\\\nin carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have\\\\ngiven her the name which I have the honor to bear\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he gave a little\\\\nstately cough\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chad not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I\\\\nbelieve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything\\\\ndishonorable would be repugnant to her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you her photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI brought this with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened a locket, and showed us the full\\\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph, but an ivory\\\\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\\\\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\\\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and\\\\nhanded it back to Lord St. Simon.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\\\nacquaintance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met\\\\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\\\\naccompli_?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\\\nwedding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas she in good spirits?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\\\nlives.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was as bright as possible\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94at least, until after the ceremony.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\\\\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident, however,\\\\nwas too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the\\\\ncase.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray let us have it, for all that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\\\\ninto the pew. There was a moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s delay, but the gentleman in the\\\\npew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse\\\\nfor the fall. Yet, when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\\\\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\\\\nagitated over this trifling cause.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\\\ngeneral public were present, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I\\\\nthink that we are wandering rather far from the point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\\\\nframe of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering\\\\nher father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd who is her maid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlice is her name. She is an American, and came from California with\\\\nher.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA confidential servant?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these\\\\nthings in a different way.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did not overhear what they said?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLady St. Simon said something about \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98jumping a claim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 She was\\\\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn your arm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.\\\\nThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\\\\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\\\nroom, covered her bride\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\\\\nand went out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house that morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and\\\\nyour relations to her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\nhave been on a friendly footing for some years\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I may say on a _very_\\\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Allegro.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I have not treated\\\\nher ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me;\\\\nbut you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing,\\\\nbut exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\\\\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married; and, to\\\\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\\\\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\\\\nto Mr. Doran\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push\\\\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\\\\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\\\\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\\\\npushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\\\\nin making a row.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid your wife hear all this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some\\\\nterrible trap for her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is a possible supposition.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou think so, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this\\\\nas likely?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\\\nyour own theory as to what took place?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have\\\\ngiven you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\\\\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\\\\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\\\\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I will\\\\nnot say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\\\nsuccess\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes,\\\\nsmiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\\\\ndata. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\\\\nyou could see out of the window?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I\\\\nshall communicate with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our\\\\nclient, rising.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have solved it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEh? What was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say that I have solved it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere, then, is my wife?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that it will take wiser\\\\nheads than yours or mine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\\\nold-fashioned manner, he departed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honor my head by putting it\\\\non a level with his own,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think\\\\nthat I shall have a whiskey-and-soda and a cigar after all this\\\\ncross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\\\\nour client came into the room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to\\\\nturn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is\\\\noccasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to\\\\nquote Thoreau\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s example.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\\\\nso well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back,\\\\nand something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\\\\nFranco-Prussian war. It is one of these cases\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but, hello, here is\\\\nLestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon\\\\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\\\\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\\\\nbag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\\\\ncigar which had been offered to him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou look\\\\ndissatisfied.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.\\\\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally! You surprise me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clew seems to slip\\\\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laying his hand\\\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn Heaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name, what for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy? What do you mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\\\nas in the other.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you know all\\\\nabout it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snarled.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\\\nmatter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think it very unlikely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this\\\\nin it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes, and a\\\\nbride\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wreath and veil, all discolored and soaked in water. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is\\\\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, indeed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\ndragged them from the Serpentine?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They\\\\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\\\\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body is to be found in\\\\nthe neighborhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive\\\\nat through this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you, indeed, now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Lestrade, with some bitterness. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am\\\\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\\\\nand your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\\\\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He slapped it down\\\\nupon the table in front of him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen to this: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You will see me when\\\\nall is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Now my theory all along has been\\\\nthat Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\\\\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\\\\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\\\\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within\\\\ntheir reach.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good, Lestrade,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou really are very fine\\\\nindeed. Let me see it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took up the paper in a listless way, but\\\\nhis attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\\\nsatisfaction. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is indeed important,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! you find it so?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\nshrieked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re looking at the wrong side!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe right side? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over\\\\nhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\\\\nwhich interests me deeply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oct.\\\\n4th, rooms 8_s._, breakfast 2_s._ 6_d._, cocktail 1_s._, lunch 2_s._\\\\n6_d._, glass sherry, 8_d._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I see nothing in that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,\\\\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\\\\nyou again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve wasted time enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade, rising. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe in hard\\\\nwork, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,\\\\nMr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\\\nfirst.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\\\nfor the door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d drawled Holmes, before his rival\\\\nvanished; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\\\nperson.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped\\\\nhis forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\\\n\\\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose and put on his\\\\novercoat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is something in what the fellow says about out-door\\\\nwork,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\\\\npapers for a little.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was after five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\\\\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nman with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a\\\\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\\\\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\\\\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\\\\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _p\\\\xc3\\\\xa2t\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 de foie gras_ pie, with a group of\\\\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\\\\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\\\\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\\\\nto this address.\\\\n\\\\nJust before nine o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\\\\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have laid the supper, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, rubbing his hands.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am\\\\nsurprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that\\\\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling\\\\nhis glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed\\\\nexpression upon his aristocratic features.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy messenger reached you, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\\\nyou good authority for what you say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe best possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat will the duke say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhen he hears that one of the\\\\nfamily has been subjected to such humiliation?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\\\nhumiliation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, you look on these things from another stand-point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fail to see that any one is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise\\\\nher at such a crisis.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lord St. Simon, tapping\\\\nhis fingers upon the table.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented\\\\na position.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\\\nshamefully used.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I heard a ring,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there are steps on\\\\nthe landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\\\nsuccessful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord St. Simon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.\\\\nFrancis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAt the sight of these new-comers our client had sprung from his seat\\\\nand stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into\\\\nthe breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady\\\\nhad taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but\\\\nhe still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\\\\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re angry, Robert,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I guess you have every cause\\\\nto be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray make no apology to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lord St. Simon, bitterly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I know that I have treated you real bad, and that I should\\\\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\\\\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what I was\\\\ndoing or saying. I only wonder I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fall down and do a faint right\\\\nthere before the altar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\\\\nroom while you explain this matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I may give an opinion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked the strange gentleman, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had\\\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\\\\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was\\\\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean shaven, with a sharp face and alert\\\\nmanner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell our story right away,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the lady. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrank here and I\\\\nmet in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9984, in McQuire\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working\\\\na claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\\\\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\\\\na claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew, the\\\\npoorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear of our engagement lasting\\\\nany longer, and he took me away to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco. Frank wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t throw up\\\\nhis hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa\\\\nknowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so\\\\nwe just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and\\\\nmake his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as\\\\nmuch as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and\\\\npledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nwe be married right away, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and then I will feel sure of\\\\nyou; and I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t claim to be your husband until I come back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Well, we\\\\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\\\\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\\\\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 camp had been\\\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name among the\\\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\\\\nthought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco.\\\\nNot a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted\\\\nthat Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco, and we\\\\ncame to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased,\\\\nbut I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the\\\\nplace in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have done my\\\\nduty by him. We can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\\\\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\\\\nwife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\\\\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing\\\\nand looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\\\\nfirst; but when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of\\\\nquestion in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\\\\nsee him. I wonder I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t drop. I know that everything was turning\\\\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\\\nin my ear. I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\\\\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\\\\nbe still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\\\\nhe was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\\\\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\\\\nreturned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\\\\nhe made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\\\\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\\\\nhe might direct.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\\\\nfew things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken\\\\nto Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\\\\nthose great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\\\\nafterwards. I hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\\\\nout of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me, and\\\\nthen began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\\\\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord\\\\nSt. Simon to me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a\\\\nlittle secret of his own before marriage also\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but I managed to get\\\\naway from her, and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and\\\\naway we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that\\\\nwas my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\\\\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco, found that\\\\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\\\\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw it in a paper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d explained the American. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt gave the name and\\\\nthe church, but not where the lady lived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\\\\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94just sending\\\\na line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful\\\\nto me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that\\\\nbreakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my\\\\nwedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should\\\\nnot be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find\\\\nthem. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only\\\\nthat this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening,\\\\nthough how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very\\\\nclearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that\\\\nwe should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then\\\\nhe offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and\\\\nso we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have\\\\nheard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope\\\\nthat you do not think very meanly of me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\\\\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\\\\nnarrative.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\\\\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forgive me? You won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shake hands before I go?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put out his hand\\\\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had hoped,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d suggested Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you would have joined us in a\\\\nfriendly supper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that there you ask a little too much,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d responded his lordship.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\\\\nhardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that, with your\\\\npermission, I will now wish you all a very good-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He included us\\\\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I trust that you at least will honor me with your company,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nSherlock Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,\\\\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and\\\\nthe blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\\\\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\\\\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\\\\nStars and Stripes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe case has been an interesting one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, when our\\\\nvisitors had left us, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause it serves to show very clearly how\\\\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\\\\nto be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the\\\\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\\\\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland\\\\nYard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I WILL WISH YOU ALL A VERY GOOD NIGHT.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\\\\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\\\\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\\\\nto change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\\\nspoken to any one when she was out, for she had been in the company\\\\nof the bridegroom. Had she seen some one, then? If she had, it must\\\\nbe some one from America, because she had spent so short a time in\\\\nthis country that she could hardly have allowed any one to acquire so\\\\ndeep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her\\\\nto change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived,\\\\nby a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\\\\nAmerican. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so\\\\nmuch influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband.\\\\nHer young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\\\\nstrange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\\\\nSimon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\\\\nthe bride\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\\\\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\\\\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94which in miners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\\\\nprior claim to\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\\\\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\\\\nhusband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the chances being in favor of the latter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how in the world did you find them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were\\\\nof course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it\\\\nto know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most\\\\nselect London hotels.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you deduce the select?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eight-pence for a\\\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are\\\\nnot many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which\\\\nI visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\\\\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\\\\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\\\\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters\\\\nwere to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and\\\\nbeing fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to\\\\ngive them some paternal advice, and to point out to them that it would\\\\nbe better in every way that they should make their position a little\\\\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\\\nappointment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut with no very good result,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis conduct was certainly\\\\nnot very gracious.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cperhaps you would not be very\\\\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\\\\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully, and thank our stars\\\\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw\\\\nyour chair up, and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have\\\\nstill to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure XI\\\\n\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\\\nthe street, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that\\\\nhis relatives should allow him to come out alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMy friend rose lazily from his arm-chair and stood with his hands in\\\\nthe pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a\\\\nbright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still\\\\nlay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down\\\\nthe centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly\\\\nband by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of\\\\nthe foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The gray pavement\\\\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\\\\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction\\\\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\\\\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\\\n\\\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\\\\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed\\\\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\\\\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions were\\\\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he\\\\nwas running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man\\\\ngives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran\\\\nhe jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\\\\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is looking up\\\\nat the numbers of the houses.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe that he is coming here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\\\nthat I recognize the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As he spoke,\\\\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\\\\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\\\n\\\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\\\\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\\\\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For\\\\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\\\\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\\\\nreason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\\\\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\\\\nto the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\\\\neasy-chair, and, sitting beside him, patted his hand, and chatted with\\\\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\nare fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\\\\nproblem which you may submit to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\\\\nhis emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\\\\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo doubt you think me mad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see that you have had some great trouble,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d responded Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod knows I have!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,\\\\nso sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,\\\\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\\\\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\\\\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\\\\nsoul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may\\\\nsuffer, unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray compose yourself, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand let me have a clear\\\\naccount of who you are, and what it is that has befallen you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered our visitor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis probably familiar to your ears.\\\\nI am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\\\nThreadneedle Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\\\\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\\\\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\\\\nof London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until\\\\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feel that time is of value,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat is why I hastened\\\\nhere when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground, and hurried\\\\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That\\\\nis why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\\\\nexercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\\\\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\\\\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\\\\nnumber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out\\\\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We\\\\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\\\\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\\\\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\\\\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the\\\\nname, for it was that of none other than\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94well, perhaps even to you I\\\\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\\\\nword all over the earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94one of the highest, noblest, most exalted\\\\nnames in England. I was overwhelmed by the honor, and attempted, when\\\\nhe entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the\\\\nair of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have been informed that you are in the habit\\\\nof advancing money.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The firm do so when the security is good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is absolutely essential to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98that I should have\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xa350,000 at once. I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten\\\\ntimes over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of\\\\nbusiness, and to carry out that business myself. In my position you\\\\ncan readily understand that it is unwise to place one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s self under\\\\nobligations.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should\\\\nbe paid at once.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\\\\nprivate purse,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98were it not that the strain would be rather\\\\nmore than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\\\\neven in your case, every business-like precaution should be taken.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should much prefer to have it so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, raising up a square,\\\\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have\\\\ndoubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Precisely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\\\\nflesh-colored velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewelry which he\\\\nhad named. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and the\\\\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would\\\\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You doubt its value?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Not at all. I only doubt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about\\\\nthat. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter\\\\nof form. Is the security sufficient?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ample.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\\\\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\\\\ngossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\\\\nevery possible precaution, because I need not say that a great public\\\\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to\\\\nit would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\\\\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\\\\nreplace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\\\\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but,\\\\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 notes.\\\\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\\\\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\\\\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no\\\\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\\\\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\\\\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe, and turned once\\\\nmore to my work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 safes had been\\\\nforced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible\\\\nwould be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out\\\\nof my reach. With this intention, I called a cab, and drove out to\\\\nmy house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe\\\\nfreely until I had taken it up-stairs and locked it in the bureau of my\\\\ndressing-room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants\\\\nwho have been with me a number of years, and whose absolute reliability\\\\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\\\\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\\\\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\\\\npretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung\\\\nabout the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her,\\\\nbut we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will\\\\nnot take me long to describe it. I am a widower, and have an only son,\\\\nArthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a grievous\\\\ndisappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell\\\\nme that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died\\\\nI felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\\\\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.\\\\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\\\\nbut I meant it for the best.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\\\\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,\\\\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large\\\\nsums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic\\\\nclub, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\\\\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\\\\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\\\\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\\\\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honor. He tried more than\\\\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\\\\neach time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to\\\\ndraw him back again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him\\\\nto my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\\\\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\\\\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\\\\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\\\\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\\\\nconvinced from his cynical speech, and the look which I have caught in\\\\nhis eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,\\\\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quick insight\\\\ninto character.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when\\\\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\\\\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is\\\\na sunbeam in my house\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager\\\\nand house-keeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could\\\\nbe. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\\\\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\\\\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\\\\nhas refused him. I think that if any one could have drawn him into the\\\\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\\\\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for ever too\\\\nlate!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night, after\\\\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\\\\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\\\\nclient. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\\\\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur\\\\nwere much interested, and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\\\\nthought it better not to disturb it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where have you put it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 asked Arthur.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98In my own bureau.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, I hope to goodness the house won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be burgled during the\\\\nnight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is locked up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\\\\nhe said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\\\\ngrave face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Look here, dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, with his eyes cast down, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98can you let me\\\\nhave \\\\xc2\\\\xa3200?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I cannot!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have been far too generous\\\\nwith you in money matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have been very kind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but I must have this money, or\\\\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And a very good thing, too!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonored man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and\\\\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You\\\\nshall not have a farthing from me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried; on which he bowed and left\\\\nthe room without another word.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see\\\\nthat all was secure\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I\\\\nthought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs\\\\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\\\\nfastened as I approached.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell me, dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98did\\\\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Certainly not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has\\\\nonly been to the side gate to see some one; but I think that it is\\\\nhardly safe, and should be stopped.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You must speak to her in the morning, or I will, if you prefer it.\\\\nAre you sure that everything is fastened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quite sure, dad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then, good-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I kissed her, and went up to my bedroom again,\\\\nwhere I was soon asleep.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am endeavoring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have\\\\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\\\\npoint which I do not make clear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two\\\\nin the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It\\\\nhad ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind\\\\nit as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening\\\\nwith all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound\\\\nof footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\\\\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\\\\ndoor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Arthur!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I screamed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that\\\\ncoronet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\\\\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\\\\nthe coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\\\\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and\\\\nturned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\\\\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You blackguard!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have\\\\ndestroyed it! You have dishonored me for ever! Where are the jewels\\\\nwhich you have stolen?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Stolen!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, you thief!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you\\\\na liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another\\\\npiece?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have called me names enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I will not stand it any\\\\nlonger. I shall not say another word about this business since you have\\\\nchosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my\\\\nown way in the world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried, half-mad\\\\nwith grief and rage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You shall learn nothing from me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, with a passion such as I\\\\nshould not have thought was in his nature. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98If you choose to call the\\\\npolice, let the police find what they can.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\\\\nmy anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\\\\nthe coronet and of Arthur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, she read the whole story, and, with\\\\na scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for\\\\nthe police, and put the investigation into their hands at once. When\\\\nthe inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\\\\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\\\\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\\\\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\\\\neverything.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98At least,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you will not have me arrested at once. It would\\\\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\\\\nfive minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\\\\nstolen,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. And then realizing the dreadful position in which I\\\\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that\\\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\\\\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\\\\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\\\nstones.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You may as well face the matter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you have been caught in\\\\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you\\\\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\\\\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he answered, turning\\\\naway from me, with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any\\\\nwords of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called\\\\nin the inspector, and gave him into custody. A search was made at once,\\\\nnot only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the\\\\nhouse where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of\\\\nthem could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all\\\\nour persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell,\\\\nand I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried\\\\nround to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the\\\\nmatter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make\\\\nnothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I\\\\nhave already offered a reward of \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000. My God, what shall I do! I have\\\\nlost my honor, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head, and rocked himself to and\\\\nfro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you receive much company?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone, save my partner with his family, and an occasional friend of\\\\nArthur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one\\\\nelse, I think.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you go out much in society?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is unusual in a young girl.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\\\nfour-and-twenty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\\\nalso.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guilt?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow can we have, when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\\\\nhis hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\\\ncoronet at all injured?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it was twisted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\\\nit?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it\\\\nis too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose\\\\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\\\\npoints about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\\\\nawoke you from your sleep?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s closing his\\\\nbedroom door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\\\\nto wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\\\\nthese gems?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\\\nhope of finding them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\\\\nalready been minutely examined.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, my dear sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis it not obvious to you now that\\\\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\\\\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\\\\ninvolved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\\\\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\\\\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of\\\\nit, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\\\\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\\\\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\\\\nsuch a theory tenable?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what other is there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the banker, with a gesture of despair.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is our task to find that out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso now, if you\\\\nplease, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,\\\\nwhich I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were\\\\ndeeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that\\\\nthe guilt of the banker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it\\\\ndid to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\njudgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long\\\\nas he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke\\\\na word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin\\\\nupon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\\\\nthought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little\\\\nglimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into\\\\na desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\\\\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\\\\nof the great financier.\\\\n\\\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back\\\\na little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad\\\\nlawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\\\\nentrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\\\\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\\\\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s entrance. On the left ran a\\\\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds\\\\nat all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left\\\\nus standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across\\\\nthe front, down the tradesmen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s path, and so round by the garden behind\\\\ninto the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\\\\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\\\\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\\\\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\\\\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\\\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\\\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\\\\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\\\\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence,\\\\nshe went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with\\\\na sweet womanly caress.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\\\ndad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instincts\\\\nare. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\\\nhaving acted so harshly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\\\nhim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\\\ncoronet in his hand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh do, do take my word\\\\nfor it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is\\\\nso dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94never, Mary! Your\\\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\\\nto inquire more deeply into it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis gentleman?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked, facing round to me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\\\nstable lane now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe stable lane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She raised her dark eyebrows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can he hope to\\\\nfind there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\\\\nArthur is innocent of this crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\\\nit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\\\nshoes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe I have the honor of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\\\nMight I ask you a question or two?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\\\\nI came down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\\\nthe windows?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere they all fastened this morning?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\\\\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\\\nhave heard uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s remarks about the coronet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\\\\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the banker,\\\\nimpatiently, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\\\\nin his hands?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\\\\nher slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes; he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\\\nname is Francis Prosper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe stood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto the left of the door\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is to say,\\\\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, he did.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expressive black\\\\neyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, you are like a magician,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s thin, eager\\\\nface.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be very glad now to go up-stairs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall probably\\\\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\\\\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\\\\nopened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\\\\npowerful magnifying lens. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow we shall go up-stairs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, at last.\\\\n\\\\nThe banker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\\\\na gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\\\\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich key was used to open it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat which my son himself indicated\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that of the cupboard of the\\\\nlumber-room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you it here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is it on the dressing-table.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a noiseless lock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is no wonder that it did not\\\\nwake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\\\nlook at it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it\\\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s art,\\\\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\\\\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\\\\ngems had been torn away.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chere is the corner which corresponds\\\\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\\\\nbreak it off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should not dream of trying,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I will.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\\\\nresult. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feel it give a little,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut, though I am\\\\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\\\\nbreak it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\\\\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\\\\nof your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\\\nHolder?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI confess that I still share my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perplexity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. We have certainly been favored with extraordinary luck\\\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\\\\nshall now continue my investigations outside.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\\\\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\\\\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\\\\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot tell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe banker wrung his hands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall never see them again!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy opinion is in no way altered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, for God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\\\\nmy house last night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\\\\nclearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\\\\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\\\\nthe sum I may draw.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would give my fortune to have them back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\\\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\\\\nbefore evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was now made up about\\\\nthe case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could\\\\neven dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I\\\\nendeavored to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to\\\\nsome other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not\\\\nyet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. He hurried to\\\\nhis chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common\\\\nloafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red\\\\ncravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that this should do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, glancing into the glass above\\\\nthe fireplace. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but\\\\nI fear that it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I\\\\nmay be following a will-of-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it\\\\nis. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He cut a slice of beef\\\\nfrom the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\\\\nbread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off\\\\nupon his expedition.\\\\n\\\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\\\\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\\\\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI only looked in as I passed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am going right on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\\\\nget back. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wait up for me in case I should be late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow are you getting on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\\\\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\\\\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\\\\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\\\\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\\\\nthan his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\\\\na touch of color upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened up-stairs, and a\\\\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\\\\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\\\n\\\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\\\\nretired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\\\\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\\\\nlateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\\\\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a\\\\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\\\\nas possible.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut you\\\\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, it is after nine now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should not be surprised if\\\\nthat were he. I thought I heard a ring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\\\\nwhich had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad\\\\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\\\\nto me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\\\\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\\\\nand he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which I pushed forward for\\\\nhim.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonored age. One sorrow\\\\ncomes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDeserted you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\\\\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\\\\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\\\\nmight have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\\\\nso. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98MY DEAREST UNCLE,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I feel that I have brought trouble\\\\n  upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible\\\\n  misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this\\\\n  thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and\\\\n  I feel that I must leave you for ever. Do not worry about my\\\\n  future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search\\\\n  for me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to\\\\n  me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving       MARY.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points\\\\nto suicide?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.\\\\nI trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\\\nsomething! Where are the gems?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou would not think \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would pay ten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a\\\\npen. Better make it out for \\\\xc2\\\\xa34000 pounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked\\\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\\\\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\\\n\\\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am saved! I am saved!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\\\\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes,\\\\nrather sternly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOwe!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He caught up a pen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cName the sum, and I will pay it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\\\\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know\\\\nthat the truth is known.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\\\nwith him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it\\\\nto him, on which he had to confess that I was right, and to add the\\\\nvery few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of\\\\nthis morning, however, may open his lips.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor Heaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\\\\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\\\\nBurnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy Mary? Impossible!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain. Neither you\\\\nnor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted\\\\nhim into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in\\\\nEngland\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man\\\\nwithout heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When\\\\nhe breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her,\\\\nshe flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil\\\\nknows best what he said, but at least she became his tool, and was in\\\\nthe habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the banker, with an ashen\\\\nface.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\\\\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\\\\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had\\\\nhe stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold\\\\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt\\\\nthat she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\\\\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\\\\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\\\ndown-stairs, on which she closed the window rapidly, and told you about\\\\none of the servants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\\\\nall perfectly true.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but\\\\nhe slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.\\\\nIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so\\\\nhe rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking\\\\nvery stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your\\\\ndressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\\\\nclothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\\\\nstrange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\\\\ncoronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\\\\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\\\\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\\\\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to some one in the\\\\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\\\\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without\\\\na horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that\\\\nshe was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for\\\\nyou, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just\\\\nas he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the\\\\nsnow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\\\\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\\\\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\\\\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\\\\nyour son struck Sir George, and cut him over the eye. Then something\\\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\\\\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\\\\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and\\\\nwas endeavoring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs it possible?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped the banker.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\\\\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain\\\\nthe true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\\\\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\\\\nview, however, and preserved her secret.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\ncried Mr. Holder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\\\\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I arrived at the house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI at once went very\\\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\\\\nimpressions. I passed along the tradesmen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s path, but found it all\\\\ntrampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\\\\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\\\\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.\\\\nI could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\\\\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.\\\\nI thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart,\\\\nof whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\\\\nI passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\\\\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\\\\nme.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\\\\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\\\\nson. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly,\\\\nand, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot,\\\\nit was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up,\\\\nand found that they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all\\\\nthe snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was\\\\na hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\\\\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,\\\\nand, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I\\\\nwas not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little\\\\nsmudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came\\\\nto the high-road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been\\\\ncleared, so there was an end to that clew.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once\\\\nsee that some one had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of\\\\nan instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\\\\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\\\\nhad waited outside the window, some one had brought the gems; the deed\\\\nhad been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled\\\\nwith him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\\\\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\\\\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man,\\\\nand who was it brought him the coronet?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\\\\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\\\\nyour niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son\\\\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\\\\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\\\\nexplanation why he should retain her secret\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the more so as the secret\\\\nwas a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at\\\\nthat window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\\\\nconjecture became a certainty.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\\\\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\\\\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\\\\nwas a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had\\\\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It\\\\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\\\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\\\\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\\\\nwithout compromising his own family.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I\\\\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house, managed to pick\\\\nup an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\\\\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\\\\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I\\\\njourneyed down to Streatham, and saw that they exactly fitted the\\\\ntracks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr.\\\\nHolder.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\\\\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\\\\nmatter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.\\\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\\\\nbluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,\\\\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\\\\nThen he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\\\\nhim a price for the stones he held\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 apiece. That brought out the\\\\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, dash it all!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I soon managed to get\\\\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\\\\nwould be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\\\\ngot our stones at \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told\\\\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\nafter what I may call a really hard day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\nbanker, rising. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed\\\\nexceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy\\\\nto apologize to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you\\\\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can\\\\ninform me where she is now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that we may safely say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d returned Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat she is\\\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\\\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\\\\npunishment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdventure XII\\\\n\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is\\\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the\\\\nkeenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,\\\\nWatson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little\\\\nrecords of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I\\\\nam bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence\\\\nnot so much to the many _causes c\\\\xc3\\\\xa9l\\\\xc3\\\\xa8bres_ and sensational trials in\\\\nwhich I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been\\\\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties\\\\nof deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\\\\nprovince.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd yet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from\\\\nthe charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have erred, perhaps,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\\\nthe tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was\\\\nwont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious, rather than a\\\\nmeditative mood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and\\\\nlife into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the\\\\ntask of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect\\\\nwhich is really the only notable feature about the thing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\nremarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which\\\\nI had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nsingular character.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, answering, as was his\\\\nwont, my thoughts rather than my words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I claim full justice for my\\\\nart, it is because it is an impersonal thing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a thing beyond myself.\\\\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather\\\\nthan upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what\\\\nshould have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast\\\\non either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A\\\\nthick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-colored houses, and the\\\\nopposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy\\\\nyellow wreaths. Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth and\\\\nglimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.\\\\nSherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously\\\\ninto the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at\\\\nlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very\\\\nsweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt the same time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat\\\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou can hardly\\\\nbe open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\\\\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not\\\\ntreat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I\\\\nendeavored to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss\\\\nMary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted\\\\nlip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are\\\\noutside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear\\\\nthat you may have bordered on the trivial.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe end may have been so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut the methods I hold to have\\\\nbeen novel and of interest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\\\\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by\\\\nhis left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!\\\\nBut, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of\\\\nthe great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all\\\\nenterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to\\\\nbe degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I\\\\nhave touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning\\\\nmarks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He tossed a crumpled letter\\\\nacross to me.\\\\n\\\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran\\\\nthus:\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I am very anxious to consult you as\\\\n  to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has\\\\n  been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten\\\\n  to-morrow, if I do not inconvenience you.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYours faithfully,     VIOLET HUNTER.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know the young lady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot I.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is half-past ten now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember\\\\nthat the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim\\\\nat first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\\\ncase, also.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for\\\\nhere, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a\\\\nplover\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own\\\\nway to make in the world.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she, as my\\\\ncompanion rose to greet her; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I have had a very strange experience,\\\\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask\\\\nadvice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what\\\\nI should do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\\\\ncan to serve you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nI could see that Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and\\\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,\\\\nand then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger tips\\\\ntogether, to listen to her story.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been a governess for five years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cin the family\\\\nof Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\\\\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over\\\\nto America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I\\\\nadvertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last\\\\nthe little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my\\\\nwits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end as to what I should do.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\\\\nWestaway\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to\\\\nsee whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was\\\\nthe name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by\\\\nMiss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are\\\\nseeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by\\\\none, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything\\\\nwhich would suit them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\\\\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout\\\\nman with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down\\\\nin fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of\\\\nglasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.\\\\nAs I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to\\\\nMiss Stoper:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That will do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I could not ask for anything better. Capital!\\\\ncapital!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together\\\\nin the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that\\\\nit was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You are looking for a situation, miss?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98As governess?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And what salary do you ask?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I had \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, tut, tut! sweating\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94rank sweating!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried, throwing his fat\\\\nhands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98How\\\\ncould any one offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions\\\\nand accomplishments?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A\\\\nlittle French, a little German, music, and drawing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tut, tut!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is all quite beside the question. The\\\\npoint is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a\\\\nlady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted\\\\nfor the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part\\\\nin the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could\\\\nany gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three\\\\nfigures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 a year.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\\\\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing\\\\nperhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and\\\\ntook out a note.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is also my custom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion\\\\nuntil his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white\\\\ncreases of his face, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98to advance to my young ladies half their salary\\\\nbeforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\\\\nand their wardrobe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful\\\\na man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a\\\\ngreat convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the\\\\nwhole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I\\\\nquite committed myself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98May I ask where you live, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the\\\\nfar side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young\\\\nlady, and the dearest old country-house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98One child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could\\\\nsee him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three\\\\ngone before you could wink!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He leaned back in his chair and laughed\\\\nhis eyes into his head again.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amusement, but\\\\nthe father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My sole duties, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98are to take charge of a single child?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to\\\\nobey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they\\\\nwere such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\\\\ndifficulty, heh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should be happy to make myself useful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\\\\nknow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which\\\\nwe might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, no.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my\\\\nhair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.\\\\nIt has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in\\\\nthis off-hand fashion.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. He had been\\\\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\\\\npass over his face as I spoke.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am afraid that it is quite essential,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is a little\\\\nfancy of my wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and ladies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nfancies must be consulted. And so you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cut your hair?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, sir, I really could not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, firmly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,\\\\nbecause in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In\\\\nthat case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young\\\\nladies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\\\\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance\\\\nupon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a\\\\nhandsome commission through my refusal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98If you please, Miss Stoper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most\\\\nexcellent offers in this fashion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You can hardly\\\\nexpect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 She struck a gong upon the table, and I\\\\nwas shown out by the page.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little\\\\nenough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began\\\\nto ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,\\\\nif these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most\\\\nextraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their\\\\neccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 a\\\\nyear. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by\\\\nwearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I\\\\nwas inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after\\\\nI was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back\\\\nto the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when I\\\\nreceived this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I\\\\nwill read it to you:\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98DEAR MISS HUNTER,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\\\n    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\\\\n    reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you\\\\n    should come, for she has been much attracted by my description\\\\n    of you. We are willing to give \\\\xc2\\\\xa330 a quarter, or \\\\xc2\\\\xa3120 a year, so\\\\n    as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads\\\\n    may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife\\\\n    is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like\\\\n    you to wear such a dress in-doors in the morning. You need not,\\\\n    however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one\\\\n    belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which\\\\n    would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting\\\\n    here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that\\\\n    need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is\\\\n    no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its\\\\n    beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must\\\\n    remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased\\\\n    salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as\\\\n    the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and\\\\n    I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know\\\\n    your train.         Yours faithfully,      JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\\\\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before\\\\ntaking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\\\\nconsideration.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\\\nquestion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, smiling.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\\\\nsister of mine apply for.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed\\\\nsome opinion?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his\\\\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear\\\\nshe should be taken to an asylum, and that he humors her fancies in\\\\nevery way in order to prevent an outbreak.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is a possible solution\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household\\\\nfor a young lady.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94too good. That is what makes\\\\nme uneasy. Why should they give you \\\\xc2\\\\xa3120 a year, when they could have\\\\ntheir pick for \\\\xc2\\\\xa340? There must be some strong reason behind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\\\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I\\\\nfelt that you were at the back of me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\\\\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my\\\\nway for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of\\\\nthe features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt would cease to be a danger if we\\\\ncould define it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram\\\\nwould bring me down to your help.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety\\\\nall swept from her face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in\\\\nmy mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor\\\\nhair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d With a few grateful\\\\nwords to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her\\\\nway.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt least,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the\\\\nstairs, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take\\\\ncare of herself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd she would need to be,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, gravely; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am much mistaken\\\\nif we do not hear from her before many days are past.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was not very long before my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s prediction was fulfilled. A\\\\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning\\\\nin her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human\\\\nexperience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary,\\\\nthe curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something\\\\nabnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were\\\\na philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to\\\\ndetermine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an\\\\nhour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\\\\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cData! data!\\\\ndata!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make bricks without clay.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And\\\\nyet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\\\never have accepted such a situation.\\\\n\\\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as\\\\nI was thinking of turning in, and Holmes was settling down to one of\\\\nthose all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in,\\\\nwhen I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night,\\\\nand find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in\\\\nthe morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the\\\\nmessage, threw it across to me.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, and turned back to his\\\\nchemical studies.\\\\n\\\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlease be at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Black Swan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hotel at Winchester at\\\\n  mid-day to-morrow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo come! I am at my wits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n  end.                                       HUNTER.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you come with me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, glancing up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should wish to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust look it up, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is a train at half-past nine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, glancing over my\\\\nBradshaw. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is due at Winchester at 11.30.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\\\\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\\\\nmorning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\n\\\\nBy eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\\\\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the\\\\nway down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them\\\\ndown, and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a\\\\nlight blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across\\\\nfrom west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\\\\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s energy.\\\\nAll over the country-side, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,\\\\nthe little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from\\\\namid the light green of the new foliage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, with all the enthusiasm of\\\\na man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\\\n\\\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat it is one of the curses of a mind\\\\nwith a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to\\\\nmy own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\\\\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which\\\\ncomes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with\\\\nwhich crime may be committed there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho would associate crime with these dear old\\\\nhomesteads?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\\\\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London\\\\ndo not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and\\\\nbeautiful country-side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou horrify me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can\\\\ndo in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so\\\\nvile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nblow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and\\\\nthen the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of\\\\ncomplaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime\\\\nand the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\\\\nfilled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of\\\\nthe law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness\\\\nwhich may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.\\\\nHad this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\\\\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country\\\\nwhich makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally\\\\nthreatened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. She has her freedom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\\\\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can\\\\nonly be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\\\\nfind waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\\\\nshall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlack Swan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no\\\\ndistance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting\\\\nfor us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon\\\\nthe table.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am so delighted that you have come,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, earnestly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is so\\\\nvery kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your\\\\nadvice will be altogether invaluable to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray tell us what has happened to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\\\\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,\\\\nthough he little knew for what purpose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet us have everything in its due order.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes thrust his long thin\\\\nlegs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\\\\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to\\\\nthem to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\\\\nmind about them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can you not understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as\\\\nit occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here, and drove me\\\\nin his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\\\\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\\\\nblock of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\\\\nand bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\\\\non the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high-road,\\\\nwhich curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\\\\nground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\\\\nof Lord Southerton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately\\\\nin front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\\\n\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\\\\nin your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her\\\\nto be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not\\\\nmore than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\\\\nforty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\\\\nmarried about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\\\\nchild by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\\\\nMr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\\\\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her step-mother. As the\\\\ndaughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\\\\nher position must have been uncomfortable with her father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s young wife.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colorless in mind as well as in\\\\nfeature. She impressed me neither favorably nor the reverse. She was a\\\\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both\\\\nto her husband and to her little son. Her light gray eyes wandered\\\\ncontinually from one to the other, noting every little want and\\\\nforestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\\\\nboisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\\\\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\\\\nin deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\\\\nhave surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\\\\ndisposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\\\\nmet so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small\\\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His\\\\nwhole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of\\\\npassion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature\\\\nweaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he\\\\nshows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little\\\\nbirds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr.\\\\nHolmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad of all details,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked my friend, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhether they seem to\\\\nyou to be relevant or not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\\\\nthing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance\\\\nand conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\\\\nToller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\\\\nhair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\\\\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\\\\ntake no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\\\\nsour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle, and much less amiable. They are\\\\na most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in\\\\nthe nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner\\\\nof the building.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, turning to me; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we are very much obliged to you,\\\\nMiss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\\\\nI assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\\\\nappearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\\\\nyou. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\\\\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\\\\nblue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\\\\nunmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been\\\\na better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\\\\nexpressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\\\\nin its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\\\\nis a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\\\\nwith three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\\\\nplaced close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\\\\nthis I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\\\\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\\\\nwas, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\\\\nhas evidently no sense of humor, never so much as smiled, but sat with\\\\nher hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\\\\nhour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\\\\nthe duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\\\\nlittle Edward in the nursery.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\\\\nwindow, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\\\\nmy employer had an immense _r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9pertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\\\\nThen he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little\\\\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\\\\nto read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\\\\nheart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\\\\nordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\\\\nthe meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\\\\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\\\\nwindow, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\\\\non behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\\\\ndevised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\\\\nseized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\\\\nthe next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\\\\nup to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\\\\nthere was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\\\\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\\\\nhowever, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\\\\nRoad, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in\\\\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\\\\npeople there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings\\\\nwhich bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\\\\nhandkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle, to find her eyes fixed upon\\\\nme with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\\\\nthat she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what\\\\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Jephro,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\\\\nthere who stares up at Miss Hunter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No; I know no one in these parts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\\\ngo away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Surely it would be better to take no notice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\\\\nand wave him away like that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\\\\nthe blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\\\\nin the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\\\\nroad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray continue,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour narrative promises to be a most\\\\ninteresting one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\\\\nbe little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.\\\\nOn the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle\\\\ntook me to a small out-house which stands near the kitchen door. As we\\\\napproached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\\\\nof a large animal moving about.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Look in here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\\\\nplanks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is he not a beauty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a\\\\nvague figure huddled up in the darkness.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be frightened,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said my employer, laughing at the start which I\\\\nhad given. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\\\\nold Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\\\\nfeed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\\\\nkeen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\\\\ntrespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sake don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you\\\\never on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\\\\nis as much as your life is worth.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\\\\nout of my bedroom window about two o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. It was a\\\\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\\\\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in\\\\nthe peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\\\\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\\\\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\\\\ntawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\\\\nbones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\\\\nupon the other side. That dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my\\\\nheart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\\\\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil\\\\nat the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed,\\\\nI began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\\\\nrearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers\\\\nin the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.\\\\nI had filled the first two with my linen, and, as I had still much\\\\nto pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the\\\\nthird drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\\\\noversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The\\\\nvery first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There\\\\nwas only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what\\\\nit was. It was my coil of hair.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\\\\nthe same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\\\\nitself upon me. How _could_ my hair have been locked in the drawer?\\\\nWith trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and\\\\ndrew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and\\\\nI assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\\\\nas I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\\\\nthe strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\\\\nRucastles, as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\\\\ndrawer which they had locked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\\\\none wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\\\\nwhich faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened\\\\ninto this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\\\\nascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\\\\nhis keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\\\\ndifferent person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\\\\ncheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\\\\nstood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\\\\npast me without a word or a look.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis aroused my curiosity; so when I went out for a walk in the\\\\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\\\\nsee the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\\\\nrow, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\\\\nup. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\\\\nglancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\\\\nmerry and jovial as ever.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\\\\nword, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assured him that I was not offended. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98By-the-way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you\\\\nseem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has\\\\nthe shutters up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\\\\nremark.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Photography is one of my hobbies,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have made my dark room\\\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He spoke\\\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\\\\nme. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\\\\non fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\\\\nshare of that. It was more a feeling of duty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a feeling that some good\\\\nmight come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ninstinct; perhaps it was woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instinct which gave me that feeling.\\\\nAt any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\\\\nchance to pass the forbidden door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\\\\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\\\\nthese deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\\\\nbag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\\\\nyesterday evening he was very drunk; and, when I came up-stairs, there\\\\nwas the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it\\\\nthere. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down-stairs, and the child was\\\\nwith them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key\\\\ngently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\\\\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\\\\nwere three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\\\\nThey each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\\\\nin the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\\\\nlight glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\\\\nacross the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of\\\\nan iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened\\\\nat the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and\\\\nthe key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with\\\\nthe shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\\\\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\\\\nskylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\\\\ngazing at the sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil,\\\\nI suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow\\\\npass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which\\\\nshone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in\\\\nme at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly,\\\\nand I turned and ran\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\\\\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\\\\nthe door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\\\\noutside.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98So,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98it was you, then. I thought that it must be\\\\nwhen I saw the door open.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, I am so frightened!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I panted.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you cannot think how\\\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and what has frightened you, my\\\\ndear young lady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\\\\nkeenly on my guard against him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But it\\\\nis so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\\\\nout again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Only that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, looking at me keenly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, what did you think?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why do you think that I lock this door?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am sure that I do not know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He\\\\nwas still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am sure if I had known\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\\\\nthreshold again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\\\\nrage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll throw\\\\nyou to the mastiff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\\\\nmust have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\\\\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\\\\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\\\\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\\\\neven of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\\\\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\\\\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\\\\nmade up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\\\\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\\\\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\\\\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\\\\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\\\\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\\\\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\\\\nfree. I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at\\\\nthe thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\\\\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\\\\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\\\\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\\\\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\\\\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\\\\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs Toller still drunk?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\\\\nwith him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, the wine-cellar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\\\\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one\\\\nmore feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\\\\nexceptional woman.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will try. What is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, my friend and I.\\\\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\\\\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\\\\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\\\\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\\\\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\\\\npersonate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\\\\nThat is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\\\\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said\\\\nto have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her\\\\nin height, figure, and the color of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\\\\nvery possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\\\\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\\\\nupon her tresses. The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of\\\\nhers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94possibly her _fianc\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and no doubt, as you wore the girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dress\\\\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever\\\\nhe saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\\\\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\\\\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate\\\\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\\\\nis the disposition of the child.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\\\\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see\\\\nthat the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\\\\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\\\\nThis child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\\\\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\\\\ntheir power.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried our client. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA\\\\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have\\\\nhit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\\\ncreature.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\\\\ncan do nothing until seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\\\\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\\\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house. The\\\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\\\\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\\\\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you managed it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\n\\\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is\\\\nMrs. Toller in the cellar,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHer husband lies snoring on\\\\nthe kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\\\nRucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have done well indeed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow lead\\\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\\\\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\\\\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\\\\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\\\\nfrom within, and at the silence Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face clouded over.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI trust that we are not too late,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Miss Hunter,\\\\nthat we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\\\\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIt was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united\\\\nstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no\\\\nfurniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of\\\\nlinen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere has been some villainy here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis beauty has\\\\nguessed Miss Hunter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s intentions, and has carried his victim off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He swung\\\\nhimself up onto the roof. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the end of a\\\\nlong light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it is impossible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Miss Hunter; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe ladder was not there\\\\nwhen the Rucastles went away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\\\\nwhose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\\\\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\\\\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\\\\nhand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\\\\nhim, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou villain!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your daughter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is for me to ask you that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shrieked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou thieves! Spies and\\\\nthieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll serve\\\\nyou!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone for the dog!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Miss Hunter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have my revolver,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter close the front door,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down\\\\nthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\\\\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\\\\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\\\\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome one has loosed the dog. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not been fed for\\\\ntwo days. Quick, quick, or it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be too late!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\\\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\\\nburied in Rucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\\\\nground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\\\\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\\\\nmuch labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly\\\\nmangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and,\\\\nhaving despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\\\\ndid what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\\\\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. Toller!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Miss Hunter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went\\\\nup to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let me know what you were\\\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller\\\\nknows more about this matter than any one else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points\\\\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will soon make it clear to you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have done\\\\nso before now if I could ha\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 got out from the cellar. If there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\npolice-court business over this, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll remember that I was the one\\\\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friend too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, from the time that\\\\nher father married again. She was slighted like, and had no say in\\\\nanything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met\\\\nMr. Fowler at a friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice\\\\nhad rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she\\\\nwas, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in\\\\nMr. Rucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was\\\\na chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the\\\\nlaw would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on\\\\nit. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not,\\\\nhe could use her money. When she wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it, he kept on worrying\\\\nher until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door.\\\\nThen she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make no change in her young\\\\nman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that what you have been good enough to\\\\ntell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all\\\\nthat remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\\\\nimprisonment?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was it, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should\\\\nbe, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain\\\\narguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests\\\\nwere the same as his.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mrs.\\\\nToller, serenely.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\\\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\\\nhad gone out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor you\\\\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\\\\nthe country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\\\\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\\\\n_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\\\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\\\\nThey still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\\\\nRucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.\\\\nMr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\\\\nSouthampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\\\\nGovernment appointment in the Island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet\\\\nHunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\\\\nfurther interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\\\\none of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\\\\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTHE END\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBY W.

From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt\\\\r\\\\nwhether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see\\\\r\\\\nthe loom of the opposite houses.  The first day Holmes had spent in\\\\r\\\\ncross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had\\\\r\\\\nbeen patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his\\\\r\\\\nhobby--the music of the Middle Ages.  But when, for the fourth time,\\\\r\\\\nafter pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy\\\\r\\\\nbrown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon\\\\r\\\\nthe window-panes, my comrade\\\\'s impatient and active nature could endure\\\\r\\\\nthis drab existence no longer.  He paced restlessly about our\\\\r\\\\nsitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping\\\\r\\\\nthe furniture, and chafing against inaction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?\\\" he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of\\\\r\\\\ncriminal interest.  There was the news of a revolution, of a possible\\\\r\\\\nwar, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come\\\\r\\\\nwithin the horizon of my companion.  I could see nothing recorded in\\\\r\\\\nthe shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile.  Holmes\\\\r\\\\ngroaned and resumed his restless meanderings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,\\\" said he in the\\\\r\\\\nquerulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. \\\"Look out\\\\r\\\\nthis window, Watson.  See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and\\\\r\\\\nthen blend once more into the cloud-bank.  The thief or the murderer\\\\r\\\\ncould roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen\\\\r\\\\nuntil he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There have,\\\" said I, \\\"been numerous petty thefts.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes snorted his contempt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than\\\\r\\\\nthat,\\\" said he.  \\\"It is fortunate for this community that I am not a\\\\r\\\\ncriminal.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It is, indeed!\\\" said I heartily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who\\\\r\\\\nhave good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against\\\\r\\\\nmy own pursuit?  A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over.\\\\r\\\\nIt is well they don\\\\'t have days of fog in the Latin countries--the\\\\r\\\\ncountries of assassination.  By Jove! here comes something at last to\\\\r\\\\nbreak our dead monotony.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was the maid with a telegram.  Holmes tore it open and burst out\\\\r\\\\nlaughing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Well, well!  What next?\\\" said he.  \\\"Brother Mycroft is coming round.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Why not?  It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane.\\\\r\\\\nMycroft has his rails and he runs on them.  His Pall Mall lodgings, the\\\\r\\\\nDiogenes Club, Whitehall--that is his cycle.  Once, and only once, he\\\\r\\\\nhas been here.  What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Does he not explain?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes handed me his brother\\\\'s telegram.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    \\\"Must see you over Cadogan West.  Coming at once.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     MYCROFT.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Cadogan West?  I have heard the name.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It recalls nothing to my mind.  But that Mycroft should break out in\\\\r\\\\nthis erratic fashion!  A planet might as well leave its orbit.  By the\\\\r\\\\nway, do you know what Mycroft is?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the\\\\r\\\\nAdventure of the Greek Interpreter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"You told me that he had some small office under the British\\\\r\\\\ngovernment.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes chuckled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I did not know you quite so well in those days.  One has to be\\\\r\\\\ndiscreet when one talks of high matters of state.  You are right in\\\\r\\\\nthinking that he is under the British government.  You would also be right\\\\r\\\\nin a sense if you said that occasionally he IS the British government.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"My dear Holmes!\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I thought I might surprise you.  Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty\\\\r\\\\npounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind,\\\\r\\\\nwill receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most\\\\r\\\\nindispensable man in the country.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But how?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Well, his position is unique.  He has made it for himself. There has\\\\r\\\\nnever been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the\\\\r\\\\ntidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing\\\\r\\\\nfacts, of any man living.  The same great powers which I have turned to\\\\r\\\\nthe detection of crime he has used for this particular business.  The\\\\r\\\\nconclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the\\\\r\\\\ncentral exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance.  All\\\\r\\\\nother men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience.  We will\\\\r\\\\nsuppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves\\\\r\\\\nthe Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his\\\\r\\\\nseparate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft\\\\r\\\\ncan focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the\\\\r\\\\nother.  They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he\\\\r\\\\nhas made himself an essential.  In that great brain of his everything\\\\r\\\\nis pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.  Again and again\\\\r\\\\nhis word has decided the national policy.  He lives in it.  He thinks\\\\r\\\\nof nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I\\\\r\\\\ncall upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems.\\\\r\\\\nBut Jupiter is descending to-day.  What on earth can it mean?  Who is\\\\r\\\\nCadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I have it,\\\" I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the\\\\r\\\\nsofa.  \\\"Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!  Cadogan West was the young\\\\r\\\\nman who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"This must be serious, Watson.  A death which has caused my brother to\\\\r\\\\nalter his habits can be no ordinary one.  What in the world can he have\\\\r\\\\nto do with it?  The case was featureless as I remember it.  The young\\\\r\\\\nman had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself.  He had\\\\r\\\\nnot been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect\\\\r\\\\nviolence.  Is that not so?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There has been an inquest,\\\" said I, \\\"and a good many fresh facts have\\\\r\\\\ncome out.  Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a\\\\r\\\\ncurious case.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a\\\\r\\\\nmost extraordinary one.\\\"  He snuggled down in his armchair. \\\"Now,\\\\r\\\\nWatson, let us have the facts.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The man\\\\'s name was Arthur Cadogan West.  He was twenty-seven years of\\\\r\\\\nage, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Government employ.  Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night.  Was last seen by his\\\\r\\\\nfiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about\\\\r\\\\n7:30 that evening.  There was no quarrel between them and she can give\\\\r\\\\nno motive for his action.  The next thing heard of him was when his\\\\r\\\\ndead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside\\\\r\\\\nAldgate Station on the Underground system in London.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"When?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The body was found at six on Tuesday morning.  It was lying wide of\\\\r\\\\nthe metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a\\\\r\\\\npoint close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in\\\\r\\\\nwhich it runs.  The head was badly crushed--an injury which might well\\\\r\\\\nhave been caused by a fall from the train.  The body could only have\\\\r\\\\ncome on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any\\\\r\\\\nneighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a\\\\r\\\\ncollector is always standing.  This point seems absolutely certain.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Very good.  The case is definite enough.  The man, dead or alive,\\\\r\\\\neither fell or was precipitated from a train.  So much is clear to me.\\\\r\\\\nContinue.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was\\\\r\\\\nfound are those which run from west to east, some being purely\\\\r\\\\nMetropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions.  It can\\\\r\\\\nbe stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was\\\\r\\\\ntravelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at\\\\r\\\\nwhat point he entered the train it is impossible to state.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"His ticket, of course, would show that.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There was no ticket in his pockets.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No ticket!  Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According\\\\r\\\\nto my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a\\\\r\\\\nMetropolitan train without exhibiting one\\\\'s ticket. Presumably, then,\\\\r\\\\nthe young man had one.  Was it taken from him in order to conceal the\\\\r\\\\nstation from which he came?  It is possible.  Or did he drop it in the\\\\r\\\\ncarriage?  That is also possible.  But the point is of curious\\\\r\\\\ninterest.  I understand that there was no sign of robbery?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Apparently not.  There is a list here of his possessions.  His purse\\\\r\\\\ncontained two pounds fifteen.  He had also a check-book on the Woolwich\\\\r\\\\nbranch of the Capital and Counties Bank.  Through this his identity was\\\\r\\\\nestablished.  There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich\\\\r\\\\nTheatre, dated for that very evening.  Also a small packet of technical\\\\r\\\\npapers.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There we have it at last, Watson!  British government--Woolwich.\\\\r\\\\nArsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.  But\\\\r\\\\nhere he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered\\\\r\\\\ninto the room.  Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of\\\\r\\\\nuncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame\\\\r\\\\nthere was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its\\\\r\\\\nsteel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its\\\\r\\\\nplay of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross\\\\r\\\\nbody and remembered only the dominant mind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and\\\\r\\\\naustere.  The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.\\\\r\\\\nThe detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out\\\\r\\\\nof his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"A most annoying business, Sherlock,\\\" said he.  \\\"I extremely dislike\\\\r\\\\naltering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial.  In\\\\r\\\\nthe present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from\\\\r\\\\nthe office.  But it is a real crisis.  I have never seen the Prime\\\\r\\\\nMinister so upset.  As to the Admiralty--it is buzzing like an\\\\r\\\\noverturned bee-hive.  Have you read up the case?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We have just done so.  What were the technical papers?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Ah, there\\\\'s the point!  Fortunately, it has not come out.  The press\\\\r\\\\nwould be furious if it did.  The papers which this wretched youth had\\\\r\\\\nin his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the\\\\r\\\\nimportance of the subject.  His brother and I sat expectant.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Surely you have heard of it?  I thought everyone had heard of it.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Only as a name.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.  It has been the most\\\\r\\\\njealously guarded of all government secrets.  You may take it from me\\\\r\\\\nthat naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a\\\\r\\\\nBruce-Partington\\\\'s operation.  Two years ago a very large sum was\\\\r\\\\nsmuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly\\\\r\\\\nof the invention.  Every effort has been made to keep the secret.  The\\\\r\\\\nplans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate\\\\r\\\\npatents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an\\\\r\\\\nelaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with\\\\r\\\\nburglar-proof doors and windows.  Under no conceivable circumstances\\\\r\\\\nwere the plans to be taken from the office.  If the chief constructor\\\\r\\\\nof the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the\\\\r\\\\nWoolwich office for the purpose.  And yet here we find them in the\\\\r\\\\npocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.  From an official\\\\r\\\\npoint of view it\\\\'s simply awful.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But you have recovered them?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No, Sherlock, no!  That\\\\'s the pinch.  We have not.  Ten papers were\\\\r\\\\ntaken from Woolwich.  There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West.\\\\r\\\\nThe three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished.  You must drop\\\\r\\\\neverything, Sherlock.  Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the\\\\r\\\\npolice-court.  It\\\\'s a vital international problem that you have to\\\\r\\\\nsolve.  Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing\\\\r\\\\nones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the\\\\r\\\\nevil be set right?  Find an answer to all these questions, and you will\\\\r\\\\nhave done good service for your country.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?  You can see as far as I.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Possibly, Sherlock.  But it is a question of getting details. Give me\\\\r\\\\nyour details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent\\\\r\\\\nexpert opinion.  But to run here and run there, to cross-question\\\\r\\\\nrailway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye--it is not my\\\\r\\\\nmetier.  No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up.  If you\\\\r\\\\nhave a fancy to see your name in the next honours list--\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend smiled and shook his head.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I play the game for the game\\\\'s own sake,\\\" said he.  \\\"But the problem\\\\r\\\\ncertainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased\\\\r\\\\nto look into it.  Some more facts, please.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper,\\\\r\\\\ntogether with a few addresses which you will find of service.  The\\\\r\\\\nactual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert,\\\\r\\\\nSir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a\\\\r\\\\nbook of reference.  He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a\\\\r\\\\nfavoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose\\\\r\\\\npatriotism is beyond suspicion.  He is one of two who have a key of the\\\\r\\\\nsafe.  I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during\\\\r\\\\nworking hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three\\\\r\\\\no\\\\'clock taking his key with him.  He was at the house of Admiral\\\\r\\\\nSinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this\\\\r\\\\nincident occurred.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Has the fact been verified?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his\\\\r\\\\ndeparture from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London;\\\\r\\\\nso Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Who was the other man with a key?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson.  He is a man of\\\\r\\\\nforty, married, with five children.  He is a silent, morose man, but he\\\\r\\\\nhas, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service.  He is\\\\r\\\\nunpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker.  According to his own\\\\r\\\\naccount, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the\\\\r\\\\nwhole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left\\\\r\\\\nthe watch-chain upon which it hangs.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Tell us about Cadogan West.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He has been ten years in the service and has done good work.  He has\\\\r\\\\nthe reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight,\\\\r\\\\nhonest man.  We have nothing against him.  He was next Sidney Johnson\\\\r\\\\nin the office.  His duties brought him into daily, personal contact\\\\r\\\\nwith the plans.  No one else had the handling of them.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Who locked up the plans that night?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.  They are\\\\r\\\\nactually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West.\\\\r\\\\nThat seems final, does it not?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained.  In the\\\\r\\\\nfirst place, why did he take them?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I presume they were of value?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London\\\\r\\\\nexcept to sell them?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No, I cannot.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.  Young West took the\\\\r\\\\npapers.  Now this could only be done by having a false key--\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Several false keys.  He had to open the building and the room.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He had, then, several false keys.  He took the papers to London to\\\\r\\\\nsell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back\\\\r\\\\nin the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on\\\\r\\\\nthis treasonable mission he met his end.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"How?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was\\\\r\\\\nkilled and thrown out of the compartment.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station\\\\r\\\\nLondon Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London\\\\r\\\\nBridge.  There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he\\\\r\\\\nwas having an absorbing interview.  This interview led to a violent\\\\r\\\\nscene in which he lost his life.  Possibly he tried to leave the\\\\r\\\\ncarriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end.  The other closed\\\\r\\\\nthe door.  There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet\\\\r\\\\nconsider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched.  We will suppose, for\\\\r\\\\nargument\\\\'s sake, that young Cadogan West HAD determined to convey these\\\\r\\\\npapers to London.  He would naturally have made an appointment with the\\\\r\\\\nforeign agent and kept his evening clear.  Instead of that he took two\\\\r\\\\ntickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly disappeared.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"A blind,\\\" said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to\\\\r\\\\nthe conversation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"A very singular one.  That is objection No. 1.  Objection No. 2: We\\\\r\\\\nwill suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent.  He\\\\r\\\\nmust bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be\\\\r\\\\ndiscovered.  He took away ten.  Only seven were in his pocket.  What\\\\r\\\\nhad become of the other three?  He certainly would not leave them of\\\\r\\\\nhis own free will.  Then, again, where is the price of his treason?\\\\r\\\\nOnce would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It seems to me perfectly clear,\\\" said Lestrade.  \\\"I have no doubt at\\\\r\\\\nall as to what occurred.  He took the papers to sell them.  He saw the\\\\r\\\\nagent. They could not agree as to price.  He started home again, but\\\\r\\\\nthe agent went with him.  In the train the agent murdered him, took the\\\\r\\\\nmore essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage.  That\\\\r\\\\nwould account for everything, would it not?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Why had he no ticket?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nhouse.  Therefore he took it from the murdered man\\\\'s pocket.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Good, Lestrade, very good,\\\" said Holmes.  \\\"Your theory holds together.\\\\r\\\\nBut if this is true, then the case is at an end.  On the one hand, the\\\\r\\\\ntraitor is dead.  On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington\\\\r\\\\nsubmarine are presumably already on the Continent.  What is there for\\\\r\\\\nus to do?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"To act, Sherlock--to act!\\\" cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \\\"All\\\\r\\\\nmy instincts are against this explanation.  Use your powers! Go to the\\\\r\\\\nscene of the crime!  See the people concerned!  Leave no stone\\\\r\\\\nunturned!  In all your career you have never had so great a chance of\\\\r\\\\nserving your country.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Well, well!\\\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \\\"Come, Watson!\\\\r\\\\nAnd you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or\\\\r\\\\ntwo?  We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station.\\\\r\\\\nGood-bye, Mycroft.  I shall let you have a report before evening, but I\\\\r\\\\nwarn you in advance that you have little to expect.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground\\\\r\\\\nrailroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately\\\\r\\\\nbefore Aldgate Station.  A courteous red-faced old gentleman\\\\r\\\\nrepresented the railway company.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"This is where the young man\\\\'s body lay,\\\" said he, indicating a spot\\\\r\\\\nabout three feet from the metals.  \\\"It could not have fallen from\\\\r\\\\nabove, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could\\\\r\\\\nonly have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it,\\\\r\\\\nmust have passed about midnight on Monday.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No record of a door being found open?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"None.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\\\" said Lestrade. \\\"A\\\\r\\\\npassenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about\\\\r\\\\n11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body\\\\r\\\\nstriking the line, just before the train reached the station.  There\\\\r\\\\nwas dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen.  He made no report\\\\r\\\\nof it at the time.  Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon\\\\r\\\\nhis face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the\\\\r\\\\ntunnel.  Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points.  On\\\\r\\\\nthese his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen,\\\\r\\\\nalert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils,\\\\r\\\\nand concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Points,\\\" he muttered; \\\"the points.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What of it?  What do you mean?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as\\\\r\\\\nthis?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No; they are very few.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"And a curve, too.  Points, and a curve.  By Jove! if it were only so.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What is it, Mr. Holmes?  Have you a clue?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"An idea--an indication, no more.  But the case certainly grows in\\\\r\\\\ninterest.  Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?  I do not see any\\\\r\\\\nindications of bleeding on the line.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There were hardly any.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"And yet one would have expected some bleeding.  Would it be possible\\\\r\\\\nfor me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the\\\\r\\\\nthud of a fall in the fog?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I fear not, Mr. Holmes.  The train has been broken up before now, and\\\\r\\\\nthe carriages redistributed.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said Lestrade, \\\"that every carriage has\\\\r\\\\nbeen carefully examined.  I saw to it myself.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was one of my friend\\\\'s most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient\\\\r\\\\nwith less alert intelligences than his own.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Very likely,\\\" said he, turning away.  \\\"As it happens, it was not the\\\\r\\\\ncarriages which I desired to examine.  Watson, we have done all we can\\\\r\\\\nhere.  We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.  I think our\\\\r\\\\ninvestigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he\\\\r\\\\nhanded to me before dispatching it.  It ran thus:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSee some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out.\\\\r\\\\nMeanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a\\\\r\\\\ncomplete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be\\\\r\\\\nin England, with full address.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"That should be helpful, Watson,\\\" he remarked as we took our seats in\\\\r\\\\nthe Woolwich train.  \\\"We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for\\\\r\\\\nhaving introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable\\\\r\\\\ncase.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung\\\\r\\\\nenergy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had\\\\r\\\\nopened up a stimulating line of thought.  See the foxhound with hanging\\\\r\\\\nears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it\\\\r\\\\nwith the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it\\\\r\\\\nruns upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in Holmes since the\\\\r\\\\nmorning.  He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in\\\\r\\\\nthe mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a\\\\r\\\\nfew hours before round the fog-girt room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There is material here.  There is scope,\\\" said he.  \\\"I am dull indeed\\\\r\\\\nnot to have understood its possibilities.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Even now they are dark to me.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead\\\\r\\\\nus far.  The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the ROOF\\\\r\\\\nof a carriage.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"On the roof!\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Remarkable, is it not?  But consider the facts.  Is it a coincidence\\\\r\\\\nthat it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as\\\\r\\\\nit comes round on the points?  Is not that the place where an object\\\\r\\\\nupon the roof might be expected to fall off?  The points would affect\\\\r\\\\nno object inside the train.  Either the body fell from the roof, or a\\\\r\\\\nvery curious coincidence has occurred.  But now consider the question\\\\r\\\\nof the blood.  Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body\\\\r\\\\nhad bled elsewhere.  Each fact is suggestive in itself.  Together they\\\\r\\\\nhave a cumulative force.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"And the ticket, too!\\\" I cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Exactly.  We could not explain the absence of a ticket.  This would\\\\r\\\\nexplain it.  Everything fits together.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling\\\\r\\\\nthe mystery of his death.  Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Perhaps,\\\" said Holmes, thoughtfully, \\\"perhaps.\\\"  He relapsed into a\\\\r\\\\nsilent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in\\\\r\\\\nWoolwich Station.  There he called a cab and drew Mycroft\\\\'s paper from\\\\r\\\\nhis pocket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\\\" said he.  \\\"I\\\\r\\\\nthink that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns\\\\r\\\\nstretching down to the Thames.  As we reached it the fog was lifting,\\\\r\\\\nand a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through.  A butler answered\\\\r\\\\nour ring.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Sir James, sir!\\\" said he with solemn face.  \\\"Sir James died this\\\\r\\\\nmorning.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Good heavens!\\\" cried Holmes in amazement.  \\\"How did he die?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel\\\\r\\\\nValentine?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, we had best do so.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we\\\\r\\\\nwere joined by a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the\\\\r\\\\nyounger brother of the dead scientist.  His wild eyes, stained cheeks,\\\\r\\\\nand unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the\\\\r\\\\nhousehold.  He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It was this horrible scandal,\\\" said he.  \\\"My brother, Sir James, was a\\\\r\\\\nman of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair.\\\\r\\\\nIt broke his heart.  He was always so proud of the efficiency of his\\\\r\\\\ndepartment, and this was a crushing blow.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would\\\\r\\\\nhave helped us to clear the matter up.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to\\\\r\\\\nall of us.  He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the\\\\r\\\\npolice.  Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty.  But\\\\r\\\\nall the rest was inconceivable.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard.  I have no\\\\r\\\\ndesire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we\\\\r\\\\nare much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this\\\\r\\\\ninterview to an end.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"This is indeed an unexpected development,\\\" said my friend when we had\\\\r\\\\nregained the cab.  \\\"I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the\\\\r\\\\npoor old fellow killed himself!  If the latter, may it be taken as some\\\\r\\\\nsign of self-reproach for duty neglected?  We must leave that question\\\\r\\\\nto the future.  Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the\\\\r\\\\nbereaved mother.  The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any\\\\r\\\\nuse to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced\\\\r\\\\nherself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the\\\\r\\\\nlast to see him upon that fatal night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\\\" she said.  \\\"I have not shut an eye\\\\r\\\\nsince the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what\\\\r\\\\nthe true meaning of it can be.  Arthur was the most single-minded,\\\\r\\\\nchivalrous, patriotic man upon earth.  He would have cut his right hand\\\\r\\\\noff before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.  It is\\\\r\\\\nabsurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But the facts, Miss Westbury?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Was he in any want of money?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample.  He had saved a\\\\r\\\\nfew hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No signs of any mental excitement?  Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely\\\\r\\\\nfrank with us.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner.  She\\\\r\\\\ncoloured and hesitated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she said at last, \\\"I had a feeling that there was something on\\\\r\\\\nhis mind.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"For long?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Only for the last week or so.  He was thoughtful and worried. Once I\\\\r\\\\npressed him about it.  He admitted that there was something, and that\\\\r\\\\nit was concerned with his official life.  \\\\'It is too serious for me to\\\\r\\\\nspeak about, even to you,\\\\' said he.  I could get nothing more.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes looked grave.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Go on, Miss Westbury.  Even if it seems to tell against him, go on.\\\\r\\\\nWe cannot say what it may lead to.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Indeed, I have nothing more to tell.  Once or twice it seemed to me\\\\r\\\\nthat he was on the point of telling me something.  He spoke one evening\\\\r\\\\nof the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he\\\\r\\\\nsaid that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend\\\\'s face grew graver still.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Anything else?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He said that we were slack about such matters--that it would be easy\\\\r\\\\nfor a traitor to get the plans.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, quite recently.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Now tell us of that last evening.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We were to go to the theatre.  The fog was so thick that a cab was\\\\r\\\\nuseless.  We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly\\\\r\\\\nhe darted away into the fog.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Without a word?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He gave an exclamation; that was all.  I waited but he never returned.\\\\r\\\\nThen I walked home.  Next morning, after the office opened, they came\\\\r\\\\nto inquire.  About twelve o\\\\'clock we heard the terrible news.  Oh, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, if you could only, only save his honour!  It was so much to\\\\r\\\\nhim.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes shook his head sadly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Come, Watson,\\\" said he, \\\"our ways lie elsewhere.  Our next station\\\\r\\\\nmust be the office from which the papers were taken.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries\\\\r\\\\nmake it blacker,\\\" he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \\\"His coming\\\\r\\\\nmarriage gives a motive for the crime.  He naturally wanted money.  The\\\\r\\\\nidea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl\\\\r\\\\nan accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans.  It is all very\\\\r\\\\nbad.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But surely, Holmes, character goes for something?  Then, again, why\\\\r\\\\nshould he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a\\\\r\\\\nfelony?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Exactly!  There are certainly objections.  But it is a formidable case\\\\r\\\\nwhich they have to meet.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received\\\\r\\\\nus with that respect which my companion\\\\'s card always commanded.  He\\\\r\\\\nwas a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard,\\\\r\\\\nand his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been\\\\r\\\\nsubjected.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad!  Have you heard of the death of the\\\\r\\\\nchief?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We have just come from his house.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The place is disorganized.  The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our\\\\r\\\\npapers stolen.  And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we\\\\r\\\\nwere as efficient an office as any in the government service.  Good\\\\r\\\\nGod, it\\\\'s dreadful to think of!  That West, of all men, should have\\\\r\\\\ndone such a thing!\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"You are sure of his guilt, then?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I can see no other way out of it.  And yet I would have trusted him as\\\\r\\\\nI trust myself.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"At what hour was the office closed on Monday?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"At five.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Did you close it?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I am always the last man out.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Where were the plans?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"In that safe.  I put them there myself.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Is there no watchman to the building?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an\\\\r\\\\nold soldier and a most trustworthy man.  He saw nothing that evening.\\\\r\\\\nOf course the fog was very thick.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building\\\\r\\\\nafter hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could\\\\r\\\\nreach the papers?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, he would.  The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and\\\\r\\\\nthe key of the safe.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I had no keys of the doors--only of the safe.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, I think he was.  I know that so far as those three keys are\\\\r\\\\nconcerned he kept them on the same ring.  I have often seen them there.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"And that ring went with him to London?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He said so.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"And your key never left your possession?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Never.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate.  And yet\\\\r\\\\nnone was found upon his body.  One other point:  if a clerk in this\\\\r\\\\noffice desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the\\\\r\\\\nplans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an\\\\r\\\\neffective way.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical\\\\r\\\\nknowledge?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"No doubt we had, but I beg you won\\\\'t try to drag me into the matter,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Holmes.  What is the use of our speculating in this way when the\\\\r\\\\noriginal plans were actually found on West?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking\\\\r\\\\noriginals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have\\\\r\\\\nequally served his turn.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Singular, no doubt--and yet he did so.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable.  Now there\\\\r\\\\nare three papers still missing.  They are, as I understand, the vital\\\\r\\\\nones.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, that is so.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without\\\\r\\\\nthe seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I reported to that effect to the Admiralty.  But to-day I have been\\\\r\\\\nover the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it.  The double valves\\\\r\\\\nwith the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers\\\\r\\\\nwhich have been returned.  Until the foreigners had invented that for\\\\r\\\\nthemselves they could not make the boat.  Of course they might soon get\\\\r\\\\nover the difficulty.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"But the three missing drawings are the most important?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Undoubtedly.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the\\\\r\\\\npremises.  I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the\\\\r\\\\niron shutters of the window.  It was only when we were on the lawn\\\\r\\\\noutside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush\\\\r\\\\noutside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having\\\\r\\\\nbeen twisted or snapped.  He examined them carefully with his lens, and\\\\r\\\\nthen some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath.  Finally he asked\\\\r\\\\nthe chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me\\\\r\\\\nthat they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for\\\\r\\\\nanyone outside to see what was going on within the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The indications are ruined by three days\\\\' delay.  They may mean\\\\r\\\\nsomething or nothing.  Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can\\\\r\\\\nhelp us further.  It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see\\\\r\\\\nif we can do better in London.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich\\\\r\\\\nStation.  The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with\\\\r\\\\nconfidence that he saw Cadogan West--whom he knew well by sight--upon\\\\r\\\\nthe Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London\\\\r\\\\nBridge.  He was alone and took a single third-class ticket.  The clerk\\\\r\\\\nwas struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner.  So shaky was\\\\r\\\\nhe that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped\\\\r\\\\nhim with it.  A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the\\\\r\\\\nfirst train which it was possible for West to take after he had left\\\\r\\\\nthe lady about 7:30.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Let us reconstruct, Watson,\\\" said Holmes after half an hour of\\\\r\\\\nsilence.  \\\"I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever\\\\r\\\\nhad a case which was more difficult to get at.  Every fresh advance\\\\r\\\\nwhich we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely\\\\r\\\\nmade some appreciable progress.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against\\\\r\\\\nyoung Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend\\\\r\\\\nthemselves to a more favourable hypothesis.  Let us suppose, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, that he had been approached by some foreign agent.  It might\\\\r\\\\nhave been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from\\\\r\\\\nspeaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the\\\\r\\\\ndirection indicated by his remarks to his fiancee.  Very good.  We will\\\\r\\\\nnow suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the\\\\r\\\\ndirection of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his\\\\r\\\\ndecisions.  Everything gave way to his duty.  He followed the man,\\\\r\\\\nreached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued\\\\r\\\\nthe thief.  In this way we get over the objection that no one would\\\\r\\\\ntake originals when he could make copies.  This outsider had to take\\\\r\\\\noriginals. So far it holds together.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What is the next step?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Then we come into difficulties.  One would imagine that under such\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the\\\\r\\\\nvillain and raise the alarm.  Why did he not do so? Could it have been\\\\r\\\\nan official superior who took the papers? That would explain West\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nconduct.  Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and\\\\r\\\\nWest started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms,\\\\r\\\\npresuming that he knew where the rooms were?  The call must have been\\\\r\\\\nvery pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no\\\\r\\\\neffort to communicate with her.  Our scent runs cold here, and there is\\\\r\\\\na vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West\\\\'s body,\\\\r\\\\nwith seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.\\\\r\\\\nMy instinct now is to work from the other end.  If Mycroft has given us\\\\r\\\\nthe list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two\\\\r\\\\ntracks instead of one.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSurely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street.  A government\\\\r\\\\nmessenger had brought it post-haste.  Holmes glanced at it and threw it\\\\r\\\\nover to me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an\\\\r\\\\naffair.  The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great\\\\r\\\\nGeorge Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions,\\\\r\\\\nNotting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington.\\\\r\\\\nThe latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as\\\\r\\\\nhaving left.  Glad to hear you have seen some light.  The Cabinet\\\\r\\\\nawaits your final report with the utmost anxiety.  Urgent\\\\r\\\\nrepresentations have arrived from the very highest quarter.  The whole\\\\r\\\\nforce of the State is at your back if you should need it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMycroft.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I\\\\'m afraid,\\\" said Holmes, smiling, \\\"that all the queen\\\\'s horses and\\\\r\\\\nall the queen\\\\'s men cannot avail in this matter.\\\"  He had spread out\\\\r\\\\nhis big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \\\"Well, well,\\\" said he\\\\r\\\\npresently with an exclamation of satisfaction, \\\"things are turning a\\\\r\\\\nlittle in our direction at last.  Why, Watson, I do honestly believe\\\\r\\\\nthat we are going to pull it off, after all.\\\"  He slapped me on the\\\\r\\\\nshoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity.  \\\"I am going out now.  It is\\\\r\\\\nonly a reconnaissance.  I will do nothing serious without my trusted\\\\r\\\\ncomrade and biographer at my elbow.  Do you stay here, and the odds are\\\\r\\\\nthat you will see me again in an hour or two.  If time hangs heavy get\\\\r\\\\nfoolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well\\\\r\\\\nthat he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour\\\\r\\\\nunless there was good cause for exultation.  All the long November\\\\r\\\\nevening I waited, filled with impatience for his return.  At last,\\\\r\\\\nshortly after nine o\\\\'clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAm dining at Goldini\\\\'s Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please\\\\r\\\\ncome at once and join me there.  Bring with you a jemmy, a dark\\\\r\\\\nlantern, a chisel, and a revolver.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nS.H.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the\\\\r\\\\ndim, fog-draped streets.  I stowed them all discreetly away in my\\\\r\\\\novercoat and drove straight to the address given.  There sat my friend\\\\r\\\\nat a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Have you had something to eat?  Then join me in a coffee and curacao.\\\\r\\\\nTry one of the proprietor\\\\'s cigars.  They are less poisonous than one\\\\r\\\\nwould expect.  Have you the tools?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"They are here, in my overcoat.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Excellent.  Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with\\\\r\\\\nsome indication of what we are about to do.  Now it must be evident to\\\\r\\\\nyou, Watson, that this young man\\\\'s body was PLACED on the roof of the\\\\r\\\\ntrain.  That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that\\\\r\\\\nit was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I should say it was impossible.  If you examine the roofs you will\\\\r\\\\nfind that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round\\\\r\\\\nthem.  Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was\\\\r\\\\nplaced on it.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"How could he be placed there?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"That was the question which we had to answer.  There is only one\\\\r\\\\npossible way.  You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels\\\\r\\\\nat some points in the West End.  I had a vague memory that as I have\\\\r\\\\ntravelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head.\\\\r\\\\nNow, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be\\\\r\\\\nany difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It seems most improbable.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies\\\\r\\\\nfail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.  Here\\\\r\\\\nall other contingencies HAVE failed.  When I found that the leading\\\\r\\\\ninternational agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses\\\\r\\\\nwhich abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a\\\\r\\\\nlittle astonished at my sudden frivolity.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Oh, that was it, was it?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, that was it.  Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had\\\\r\\\\nbecome my objective.  I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station,\\\\r\\\\nwhere a very helpful official walked with me along the track and\\\\r\\\\nallowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of\\\\r\\\\nCaulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact\\\\r\\\\nthat, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the\\\\r\\\\nUnderground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at\\\\r\\\\nthat very spot.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Splendid, Holmes!  You have got it!\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"So far--so far, Watson.  We advance, but the goal is afar. Well,\\\\r\\\\nhaving seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and\\\\r\\\\nsatisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown.  It is a considerable\\\\r\\\\nhouse, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms.\\\\r\\\\nOberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a\\\\r\\\\nconfederate entirely in his confidence.  We must bear in mind that\\\\r\\\\nOberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not\\\\r\\\\nwith any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and\\\\r\\\\nthe idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to\\\\r\\\\nhim.  Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Hardly on the evidence.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What can we hope to do?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I don\\\\'t like it, Holmes.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street.  I\\\\'ll do the\\\\r\\\\ncriminal part.  It\\\\'s not a time to stick at trifles.  Think of\\\\r\\\\nMycroft\\\\'s note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who\\\\r\\\\nwaits for news.  We are bound to go.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy answer was to rise from the table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"You are right, Holmes.  We are bound to go.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe sprang up and shook me by the hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I knew you would not shrink at the last,\\\" said he, and for a moment I\\\\r\\\\nsaw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had\\\\r\\\\never seen.  The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once\\\\r\\\\nmore.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.  Let us walk,\\\" said\\\\r\\\\nhe.  \\\"Don\\\\'t drop the instruments, I beg.  Your arrest as a suspicious\\\\r\\\\ncharacter would be a most unfortunate complication.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCaulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and\\\\r\\\\nporticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle\\\\r\\\\nVictorian epoch in the West End of London.  Next door there appeared to\\\\r\\\\nbe a children\\\\'s party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the\\\\r\\\\nclatter of a piano resounded through the night.  The fog still hung\\\\r\\\\nabout and screened us with its friendly shade.  Holmes had lit his\\\\r\\\\nlantern and flashed it upon the massive door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"This is a serious proposition,\\\" said he.  \\\"It is certainly bolted as\\\\r\\\\nwell as locked.  We would do better in the area.  There is an excellent\\\\r\\\\narchway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.\\\\r\\\\nGive me a hand, Watson, and I\\\\'ll do the same for you.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA minute later we were both in the area.  Hardly had we reached the\\\\r\\\\ndark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog\\\\r\\\\nabove.  As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower\\\\r\\\\ndoor.  I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew\\\\r\\\\nopen.  We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door\\\\r\\\\nbehind us.  Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair.  His\\\\r\\\\nlittle fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Here we are, Watson--this must be the one.\\\"  He threw it open, and as\\\\r\\\\nhe did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud\\\\r\\\\nroar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light\\\\r\\\\nalong the window-sill.  It was thickly coated with soot from the\\\\r\\\\npassing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"You can see where they rested the body.  Halloa, Watson! what is this?\\\\r\\\\nThere can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.\\\"  He was pointing to\\\\r\\\\nfaint discolourations along the woodwork of the window.  \\\"Here it is on\\\\r\\\\nthe stone of the stair also.  The demonstration is complete.  Let us\\\\r\\\\nstay here until a train stops.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had not long to wait.  The very next train roared from the tunnel as\\\\r\\\\nbefore, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes,\\\\r\\\\npulled up immediately beneath us.  It was not four feet from the\\\\r\\\\nwindow-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the\\\\r\\\\nwindow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"So far we are justified,\\\" said he.  \\\"What do you think of it, Watson?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"A masterpiece.  You have never risen to a greater height.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I cannot agree with you there.  From the moment that I conceived the\\\\r\\\\nidea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very\\\\r\\\\nabstruse one, all the rest was inevitable.  If it were not for the\\\\r\\\\ngrave interests involved the affair up to this point would be\\\\r\\\\ninsignificant.  Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we\\\\r\\\\nmay find something here which may help us.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon\\\\r\\\\nthe first floor.  One was a dining-room, severely furnished and\\\\r\\\\ncontaining nothing of interest.  A second was a bedroom, which also\\\\r\\\\ndrew blank.  The remaining room appeared more promising, and my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion settled down to a systematic examination.  It was littered\\\\r\\\\nwith books and papers, and was evidently used as a study.  Swiftly and\\\\r\\\\nmethodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and\\\\r\\\\ncupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his\\\\r\\\\naustere face.  At the end of an hour he was no further than when he\\\\r\\\\nstarted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The cunning dog has covered his tracks,\\\" said he.  \\\"He has left\\\\r\\\\nnothing to incriminate him.  His dangerous correspondence has been\\\\r\\\\ndestroyed or removed.  This is our last chance.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes\\\\r\\\\npried it open with his chisel.  Several rolls of paper were within,\\\\r\\\\ncovered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what\\\\r\\\\nthey referred.  The recurring words, \\\"water pressure\\\" and \\\"pressure to\\\\r\\\\nthe square inch\\\" suggested some possible relation to a submarine.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes tossed them all impatiently aside.  There only remained an\\\\r\\\\nenvelope with some small newspaper slips inside it.  He shook them out\\\\r\\\\non the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had\\\\r\\\\nbeen raised.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What\\\\'s this, Watson?  Eh?  What\\\\'s this?  Record of a series of\\\\r\\\\nmessages in the advertisements of a paper.  Daily Telegraph agony\\\\r\\\\ncolumn by the print and paper.  Right-hand top corner of a page. No\\\\r\\\\ndates--but messages arrange themselves.  This must be the first:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Hoped to hear sooner.  Terms agreed to.  Write fully to address given\\\\r\\\\non card.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Next comes:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Too complex for description.  Must have full report, Stuff awaits you\\\\r\\\\nwhen goods delivered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Then comes:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Matter presses.  Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make\\\\r\\\\nappointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Finally:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Monday night after nine.  Two taps.  Only ourselves.  Do not be so\\\\r\\\\nsuspicious.  Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"A fairly complete record, Watson!  If we could only get at the man at\\\\r\\\\nthe other end!\\\"  He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the\\\\r\\\\ntable.  Finally he sprang to his feet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Well, perhaps it won\\\\'t be so difficult, after all.  There is nothing\\\\r\\\\nmore to be done here, Watson.  I think we might drive round to the\\\\r\\\\noffices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day\\\\'s work to a\\\\r\\\\nconclusion.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after\\\\r\\\\nbreakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our\\\\r\\\\nproceedings of the day before.  The professional shook his head over\\\\r\\\\nour confessed burglary.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"We can\\\\'t do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said he. \\\"No\\\\r\\\\nwonder you get results that are beyond us.  But some of these days\\\\r\\\\nyou\\\\'ll go too far, and you\\\\'ll find yourself and your friend in trouble.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson?  Martyrs on the altar of our\\\\r\\\\ncountry.  But what do you think of it, Mycroft?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Excellent, Sherlock!  Admirable!  But what use will you make of it?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Have you seen Pierrot\\\\'s advertisement to-day?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What?  Another one?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Yes, here it is:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"To-night.  Same hour.  Same place.  Two taps.  Most vitally important.\\\\r\\\\nYour own safety at stake.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Pierrot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"By George!\\\" cried Lestrade.  \\\"If he answers that we\\\\'ve got him!\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"That was my idea when I put it in.  I think if you could both make it\\\\r\\\\nconvenient to come with us about eight o\\\\'clock to Caulfield Gardens we\\\\r\\\\nmight possibly get a little nearer to a solution.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his\\\\r\\\\npower of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his\\\\r\\\\nthoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he\\\\r\\\\ncould no longer work to advantage.  I remember that during the whole of\\\\r\\\\nthat memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had\\\\r\\\\nundertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.  For my own part I had\\\\r\\\\nnone of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared\\\\r\\\\nto be interminable.  The great national importance of the issue, the\\\\r\\\\nsuspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we\\\\r\\\\nwere trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.  It was a relief to me\\\\r\\\\nwhen at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition.\\\\r\\\\nLestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester\\\\r\\\\nRoad Station.  The area door of Oberstein\\\\'s house had been left open\\\\r\\\\nthe night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in\\\\r\\\\nand open the hall door.  By nine o\\\\'clock we were all seated in the\\\\r\\\\nstudy, waiting patiently for our man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn hour passed and yet another.  When eleven struck, the measured beat\\\\r\\\\nof the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes.\\\\r\\\\nLestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a\\\\r\\\\nminute at their watches.  Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids\\\\r\\\\nhalf shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a\\\\r\\\\nsudden jerk.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He is coming,\\\" said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere had been a furtive step past the door.  Now it returned. We heard\\\\r\\\\na shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes rose, motioning us to remain seated.  The gas in the hall was a\\\\r\\\\nmere point of light.  He opened the outer door, and then as a dark\\\\r\\\\nfigure slipped past him he closed and fastened it.  \\\"This way!\\\" we\\\\r\\\\nheard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us.  Holmes had\\\\r\\\\nfollowed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and\\\\r\\\\nalarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room.\\\\r\\\\nBefore our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and\\\\r\\\\nHolmes standing with his back against it.  The man glared round him,\\\\r\\\\nstaggered, and fell senseless upon the floor.  With the shock, his\\\\r\\\\nbroad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his\\\\r\\\\nlips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome\\\\r\\\\ndelicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes gave a whistle of surprise.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,\\\" said he.  \\\"This was\\\\r\\\\nnot the bird that I was looking for.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Who is he?\\\" asked Mycroft eagerly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the\\\\r\\\\nSubmarine Department.  Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is\\\\r\\\\ncoming to.  I think that you had best leave his examination to me.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had carried the prostrate body to the sofa.  Now our prisoner sat\\\\r\\\\nup, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand\\\\r\\\\nover his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What is this?\\\" he asked.  \\\"I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Everything is known, Colonel Walter,\\\" said Holmes.  \\\"How an English\\\\r\\\\ngentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension.\\\\r\\\\nBut your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within\\\\r\\\\nour knowledge.  So also are the circumstances connected with the death\\\\r\\\\nof young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small\\\\r\\\\ncredit for repentance and confession, since there are still some\\\\r\\\\ndetails which we can only learn from your lips.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man groaned and sank his face in his hands.  We waited, but he was\\\\r\\\\nsilent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I can assure you,\\\" said Holmes, \\\"that every essential is already\\\\r\\\\nknown.  We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an\\\\r\\\\nimpress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into\\\\r\\\\na correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the\\\\r\\\\nadvertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph.  We are aware that you\\\\r\\\\nwent down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were\\\\r\\\\nseen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous\\\\r\\\\nreason to suspect you.  He saw your theft, but could not give the\\\\r\\\\nalarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your\\\\r\\\\nbrother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good\\\\r\\\\ncitizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at\\\\r\\\\nyour heels until you reached this very house.  There he intervened, and\\\\r\\\\nthen it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more\\\\r\\\\nterrible crime of murder.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I did not!  I did not!  Before God I swear that I did not!\\\" cried our\\\\r\\\\nwretched prisoner.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon\\\\r\\\\nthe roof of a railway carriage.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I will.  I swear to you that I will.  I did the rest.  I confess it.\\\\r\\\\nIt was just as you say.  A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid.  I\\\\r\\\\nneeded the money badly.  Oberstein offered me five thousand.  It was to\\\\r\\\\nsave myself from ruin.  But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What happened, then?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe.  I\\\\r\\\\nnever knew it until I was at the very door.  It was thick fog, and one\\\\r\\\\ncould not see three yards.  I had given two taps and Oberstein had come\\\\r\\\\nto the door.  The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were\\\\r\\\\nabout to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver.  He\\\\r\\\\nalways carried it with him.  As West forced his way after us into the\\\\r\\\\nhouse Oberstein struck him on the head.  The blow was a fatal one.  He\\\\r\\\\nwas dead within five minutes.  There he lay in the hall, and we were at\\\\r\\\\nour wit\\\\'s end what to do.  Then Oberstein had this idea about the\\\\r\\\\ntrains which halted under his back window.  But first he examined the\\\\r\\\\npapers which I had brought.  He said that three of them were essential,\\\\r\\\\nand that he must keep them.  \\\\'You cannot keep them,\\\\' said I.  \\\\'There\\\\r\\\\nwill be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.\\\\'  \\\\'I must\\\\r\\\\nkeep them,\\\\' said he, \\\\'for they are so technical that it is impossible\\\\r\\\\nin the time to make copies.\\\\' \\\\'Then they must all go back together\\\\r\\\\nto-night,\\\\' said I.  He thought for a little, and then he cried out that\\\\r\\\\nhe had it. \\\\'Three I will keep,\\\\' said he.  \\\\'The others we will stuff\\\\r\\\\ninto the pocket of this young man.  When he is found the whole business\\\\r\\\\nwill assuredly be put to his account.\\\\'  I could see no other way out of\\\\r\\\\nit, so we did as he suggested.  We waited half an hour at the window\\\\r\\\\nbefore a train stopped.  It was so thick that nothing could be seen,\\\\r\\\\nand we had no difficulty in lowering West\\\\'s body on to the train.  That\\\\r\\\\nwas the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"And your brother?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think\\\\r\\\\nthat he suspected.  I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know,\\\\r\\\\nhe never held up his head again.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was silence in the room.  It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Can you not make reparation?  It would ease your conscience, and\\\\r\\\\npossibly your punishment.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"What reparation can I make?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Where is Oberstein with the papers?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I do not know.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Did he give you no address?\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually\\\\r\\\\nreach him.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Then reparation is still within your power,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"I will do anything I can.  I owe this fellow no particular good-will.\\\\r\\\\nHe has been my ruin and my downfall.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Here are paper and pen.  Sit at this desk and write to my dictation.\\\\r\\\\nDirect the envelope to the address given.  That is right.  Now the\\\\r\\\\nletter:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"Dear Sir:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now\\\\r\\\\nthat one essential detail is missing.  I have a tracing which will make\\\\r\\\\nit complete.  This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I\\\\r\\\\nmust ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds.  I will not\\\\r\\\\ntrust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes.  I\\\\r\\\\nwould come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the\\\\r\\\\ncountry at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the\\\\r\\\\nsmoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday.  Remember\\\\r\\\\nthat only English notes, or gold, will be taken.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\"That will do very well.  I shall be very much surprised if it does not\\\\r\\\\nfetch our man.\\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd it did!  It is a matter of history--that secret history of a nation\\\\r\\\\nwhich is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public\\\\r\\\\nchronicles--that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime,\\\\r\\\\ncame to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British\\\\r\\\\nprison.  In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans,\\\\r\\\\nwhich he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nColonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his\\\\r\\\\nsentence.  As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon\\\\r\\\\nthe Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for\\\\r\\\\nprivate circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon\\\\r\\\\nthe subject.  Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my\\\\r\\\\nfriend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably\\\\r\\\\nfine emerald tie-pin.  When I asked him if he had bought it, he\\\\r\\\\nanswered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose\\\\r\\\\ninterests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small\\\\r\\\\ncommission.  He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that\\\\r\\\\nlady\\\\'s august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will\\\\r\\\\nforever recall to my friend\\\\'s memory the adventure of the\\\\r\\\\nBruce-Partington plans.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington\\\\r\\\\nPlans, by Arthur Conan Doyle\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS ***\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n***** This file should be named 2346.txt or 2346.zip *****\\\\r\\\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\\\r\\\\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/4/2346/\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProduced by David Brannan.

N., stepped from the platform at Newton Abbot into a\\\\r\\\\nfirst-class compartment of the Plymouth Express. A porter followed him\\\\r\\\\nwith a heavy suitcase. He was about to swing it up to the rack, but\\\\r\\\\nthe young sailor stopped him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94leave it on the seat. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll put it up later. Here you are.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The porter, generously tipped, withdrew.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDoors banged; a stentorian voice shouted: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlymouth only. Change for\\\\r\\\\nTorquay. Plymouth next stop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then a whistle blew, and the train drew\\\\r\\\\nslowly out of the station.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLieutenant Simpson had the carriage to himself. The December air was\\\\r\\\\nchilly, and he pulled up the window. Then he sniffed vaguely, and\\\\r\\\\nfrowned. What a smell there was! Reminded him of that time in\\\\r\\\\nhospital, and the operation on his leg. Yes, chloroform; that was it!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe let the window down again, changing his seat to one with its back\\\\r\\\\nto the engine. He pulled a pipe out of his pocket and lit it. For a\\\\r\\\\nlittle time he sat inactive, looking out into the night and smoking.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt last he roused himself, and opening the suitcase, took out some\\\\r\\\\npapers and magazines, then closed the suitcase again and endeavored to\\\\r\\\\nshove it under the opposite seat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94without success. Some hidden obstacle\\\\r\\\\nresisted it. He shoved harder with rising impatience, but it still\\\\r\\\\nstuck out halfway into the carriage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy the devil wont it go in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered, and hauling it out\\\\r\\\\ncompletely, he stooped down and peered under the seat....\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA moment later a cry rang out into the night, and the great train came\\\\r\\\\nto an unwilling halt in obedience to the imperative jerking of the\\\\r\\\\ncommunication-cord.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMon ami,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Poirot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have, I know, been deeply interested in\\\\r\\\\nthis mystery of the Plymouth Express. Read this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI picked up the note he flicked across the table to me. It was brief\\\\r\\\\nand to the point.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    Dear Sir:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    I shall be obliged if you will call upon me at your\\\\r\\\\n    earliest convenience.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                Yours faithfully,\\\\r\\\\n                                      Ebenezer Halliday.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe connection was not clear to my mind, and I looked inquiringly at\\\\r\\\\nPoirot. For answer he took up the newspaper and read aloud:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A sensational discovery was made last night. A young naval officer\\\\r\\\\nreturning to Plymouth found under the seat of his compartment, the\\\\r\\\\nbody of a woman, stabbed through the heart. The officer at once pulled\\\\r\\\\nthe communication-cord, and the train was brought to a standstill. The\\\\r\\\\nwoman who was about thirty years of age, and richly dressed, has not\\\\r\\\\nyet been identified.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd later we have this: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The woman found dead in the Plymouth Express\\\\r\\\\nhas been identified as the Honorable Mrs. Rupert Carrington.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 You see\\\\r\\\\nnow, my friend? Or if you do not, I will add this. Mrs. Rupert\\\\r\\\\nCarrington was, before her marriage, Flossie Halliday, daughter of old\\\\r\\\\nman Halliday, the steel king of America.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd he has sent for you? Splendid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did him a little service in the past\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94an affair of bearer bonds. And\\\\r\\\\nonce, when I was in Paris for a royal visit, I had Mademoiselle\\\\r\\\\nFlossie pointed out to me. _La jolie petite pensionnaire!_ She had the\\\\r\\\\n_jolie dot_ too! It caused trouble. She nearly made a bad affair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA certain Count de la Rochefour. _Un bien mauvais sujet!_ A bad hat,\\\\r\\\\nas you would say. An adventurer pure and simple, who knew how to\\\\r\\\\nappeal to a romantic young girl. Luckily her father got wind of it in\\\\r\\\\ntime. He took her back to America in haste. I heard of her marriage\\\\r\\\\nsome years later, but I know nothing of her husband.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Honorable Rupert Carrington is no beauty, by all\\\\r\\\\naccounts. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d pretty well run through his own money on the turf, and\\\\r\\\\nI should imagine old man Halliday\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dollars came along in the nick of\\\\r\\\\ntime. I should say that for a good-looking, well-mannered, utterly\\\\r\\\\nunscrupulous young scoundrel, it would be hard to find his match!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, the poor little lady! _Elle n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99est pas bien tomb\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e!_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy he made it pretty obvious at once that it was her money, and\\\\r\\\\nnot she, that had attracted him. I believe they drifted apart almost\\\\r\\\\nat once. I have heard rumors lately that there was to be a definite\\\\r\\\\nlegal separation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOld man Halliday is no fool. He would tie up her money pretty tight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dare say. Anyway, I know as a fact that the Honorable Rupert is\\\\r\\\\nsaid to be extremely hard up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh-ha! I wonder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou wonder what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy good friend, do not jump down my throat like that. You are\\\\r\\\\ninterested, I see. Supposing you accompany me to see Mr. Halliday.\\\\r\\\\nThere is a taxi stand at the corner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA very few minutes sufficed to whirl us to the superb house in Park\\\\r\\\\nLane rented by the American magnate. We were shown into the library,\\\\r\\\\nand almost immediately we were joined by a large, stout man, with\\\\r\\\\npiercing eyes and an aggressive chin.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cM. Poirot?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Halliday. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI guess I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need to tell you what\\\\r\\\\nI want you for. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read the papers, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m never one to let the\\\\r\\\\ngrass grow under my feet. I happened to hear you were in London, and I\\\\r\\\\nremembered the good work you did over those bonds. Never forget a\\\\r\\\\nname. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the pick of Scotland Yard, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have my own man as\\\\r\\\\nwell. Money no object. All the dollars were made for my little\\\\r\\\\ngirl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and now she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll spend my last cent to catch the damned\\\\r\\\\nscoundrel that did it! See? So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up to you to deliver the goods.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot bowed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI accept, monsieur, all the more willingly that I saw your daughter\\\\r\\\\nin Paris several times. And now I will ask you to tell me the\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances of her journey to Plymouth and any other details that\\\\r\\\\nseem to you to bear upon the case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to begin with,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d responded Halliday, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to\\\\r\\\\nPlymouth. She was going to join a house-party at Avonmead Court, the\\\\r\\\\nDuchess of Swansea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place. She left London by the twelve-fourteen\\\\r\\\\nfrom Paddington, arriving at Bristol (where she had to change) at\\\\r\\\\ntwo-fifty. The principal Plymouth expresses, of course, run via\\\\r\\\\nWestbury, and do not go near Bristol at all. The twelve-fourteen does\\\\r\\\\na nonstop run to Bristol, afterward stopping at Weston, Taunton,\\\\r\\\\nExeter and Newton Abbot. My daughter traveled alone in her carriage,\\\\r\\\\nwhich was reserved as far as Bristol, her maid being in a third-class\\\\r\\\\ncarriage in the next coach.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot nodded, and Mr. Halliday went on: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe party at Avonmead Court\\\\r\\\\nwas to be a very gay one, with several balls, and in consequence my\\\\r\\\\ndaughter had with her nearly all her jewels\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94amounting in value\\\\r\\\\nperhaps, to about a hundred thousand dollars.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Un moment_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d interrupted Poirot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho had charge of the jewels? Your\\\\r\\\\ndaughter, or the maid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy daughter always took charge of them herself, carrying them in a\\\\r\\\\nsmall blue morocco case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cContinue, monsieur.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt Bristol the maid, Jane Mason, collected her mistress\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dressing-bag\\\\r\\\\nand wraps, which were with her, and came to the door of Flossie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ncompartment. To her intense surprise, my daughter told her that she\\\\r\\\\nwas not getting out at Bristol, but was going on farther. She directed\\\\r\\\\nMason to get out the luggage and put it in the cloak-room. She could\\\\r\\\\nhave tea in the refreshment-room, but she was to wait at the station\\\\r\\\\nfor her mistress, who would return to Bristol by an up-train in the\\\\r\\\\ncourse of the afternoon. The maid, although very much astonished, did\\\\r\\\\nas she was told. She put the luggage in the cloak-room and had some\\\\r\\\\ntea. But up-train after up-train came in, and her mistress did not\\\\r\\\\nappear. After the arrival of the last train, she left the luggage\\\\r\\\\nwhere it was, and went to a hotel near the station for the night. This\\\\r\\\\nmorning she read of the tragedy, and returned to town by the first\\\\r\\\\navailable train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs there nothing to account for your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden change of\\\\r\\\\nplan?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there is this: According to Jane Mason, at Bristol, Flossie was\\\\r\\\\nno longer alone in her carriage. There was a man in it who stood\\\\r\\\\nlooking out of the farther window so that she could not see his face.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe train was a corridor one, of course?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich side was the corridor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the platform side. My daughter was standing in the corridor as she\\\\r\\\\ntalked to Mason.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd there is no doubt in your mind\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94excuse me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He got up, and\\\\r\\\\ncarefully straightened the inkstand which was a little askew. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Je\\\\r\\\\nvous demande pardon_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, reseating himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt affects my\\\\r\\\\nnerves to see anything crooked. Strange, is it not? I was saying,\\\\r\\\\nmonsieur, that there is no doubt in your mind, as to this probably\\\\r\\\\nunexpected meeting being the cause of your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden change of\\\\r\\\\nplan?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems the only reasonable supposition.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have no idea as to who the gentleman in question might be?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe millionaire hesitated for a moment, and then replied.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I do not know at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94as to the discovery of the body?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was discovered by a young naval officer who at once gave the\\\\r\\\\nalarm. There was a doctor on the train. He examined the body. She had\\\\r\\\\nbeen first chloroformed, and then stabbed. He gave it as his opinion\\\\r\\\\nthat she had been dead about four hours, so it must have been done not\\\\r\\\\nlong after leaving Bristol. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Probably between there and Weston,\\\\r\\\\npossibly between Weston and Taunton.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the jewel-case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe jewel-case, M. Poirot, was missing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne thing more, monsieur. Your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fortune\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94to whom does it\\\\r\\\\npass at her death?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlossie made a will soon after her marriage, leaving everything to\\\\r\\\\nher husband.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He hesitated for a minute, and then went on: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI may as\\\\r\\\\nwell tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that I regard my son-in-law as an\\\\r\\\\nunprincipled scoundrel, and that, by my advice, my daughter was on the\\\\r\\\\neve of freeing herself from him by legal means\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94no difficult matter. I\\\\r\\\\nsettled her money upon her in such a way that he could not touch it\\\\r\\\\nduring her lifetime, but although they have lived entirely apart for\\\\r\\\\nsome years, she has frequently acceded to his demands for money,\\\\r\\\\nrather than face an open scandal. However, I was determined to put an\\\\r\\\\nend to this, and at last Flossie agreed, and my lawyers were\\\\r\\\\ninstructed to take proceedings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd where is Monsieur Carrington?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn town. I believe he was away in the country yesterday, but he\\\\r\\\\nreturned last night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot considered a little while. Then he said: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that is all,\\\\r\\\\nmonsieur.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou would like to see the maid, Jane Mason?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHalliday rang the bell, and gave a short order to the footman. A few\\\\r\\\\nminutes later Jane Mason entered the room, a respectable,\\\\r\\\\nhard-featured woman, as emotionless in the face of tragedy as only a\\\\r\\\\ngood servant can be.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will permit me to put a few questions? Your mistress, she was\\\\r\\\\nquite as usual before starting yesterday morning? Not excited or\\\\r\\\\nflurried?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut at Bristol she was quite different?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes sir, regular upset\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94so nervous she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to know what she\\\\r\\\\nwas saying.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did she say exactly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell sir, as near as I can remember, she said: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mason, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to\\\\r\\\\nalter my plans. Something has happened\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I mean, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not getting out\\\\r\\\\nhere after all. I must go on. Get out the luggage and put it in the\\\\r\\\\ncloak-room; then have some tea, and wait for me in the station.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Wait for you here, ma\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99am?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, yes. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave the station. I shall return by a later train.\\\\r\\\\nI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know when. It mayn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be until quite late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very well, ma\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99am,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I says. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t my place to ask questions, but\\\\r\\\\nI thought it very strange.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was unlike your mistress, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery unlike her, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you think?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell sir, I thought it was to do with the gentleman in the carriage.\\\\r\\\\nShe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to him, but she turned round once or twice as though\\\\r\\\\nto ask him if she was doing right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo sir; he stood with his back to me all the time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you describe him at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe had on a light fawn overcoat, and a traveling cap. He was tall and\\\\r\\\\nslender, like, and the back of his head was dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was not your master, Mr. Carrington, by any chance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMason looked rather startled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh! I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you are not _sure_?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was about the master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s build, sir\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but I never thought of it being\\\\r\\\\nhim. We so seldom saw him. I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say it _wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t_ him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot picked up a pin from the carpet, and frowned at it severely;\\\\r\\\\nthen he continued: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould it be possible for the man to have entered\\\\r\\\\nthe train at Bristol before you reached the carriage?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMason considered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes sir, I think it would. My compartment was very crowded, and it\\\\r\\\\nwas some minutes before I could get out\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and then there was a very\\\\r\\\\nlarge crowd on the platform, and that delayed me too. But he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d only\\\\r\\\\nhave had a minute or two to speak to the mistress, that way. I took it\\\\r\\\\nfor granted that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d come along the corridor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is more probable, certainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe paused, still frowning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know how the mistress was dressed, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe papers give a few details, but I would like you to confirm them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was wearing a white fox fur toque, sir, with a white spotted\\\\r\\\\nveil, and a blue frieze coat and skirt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the shade of blue they call\\\\r\\\\nelectric.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m, rather striking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Halliday. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cInspector Japp is in hopes that that may\\\\r\\\\nhelp us to fix the spot where the crime took place. Anyone who saw her\\\\r\\\\nwould remember her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Pr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9cis\\\\xc3\\\\xa9ment!_ \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Thank you, mademoiselle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The maid left the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot got up briskly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is all I can do here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94except,\\\\r\\\\nmonsieur, that I would ask you to tell me everything\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but\\\\r\\\\n_everything_!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have done so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen there is nothing more to be said. I must decline the case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause you have not been frank with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assure you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, you are keeping something back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was a moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pause, and then Halliday drew a paper from his\\\\r\\\\npocket and handed it to my friend.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI guess that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re after, Monsieur Poirot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94though how you know\\\\r\\\\nabout it fairly gets my goat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot smiled, and unfolded the paper. It was a letter written in thin\\\\r\\\\nsloping handwriting. Poirot read it aloud.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ch\\\\xc3\\\\xa8re Madame:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is with infinite pleasure that I look forward to the\\\\r\\\\n    felicity of meeting you again. After your so amiable reply to\\\\r\\\\n    my letter, I can hardly restrain my impatience. I have never\\\\r\\\\n    forgotten those days in Paris. It is most cruel that you\\\\r\\\\n    should be leaving London tomorrow. However, before very long,\\\\r\\\\n    and perhaps sooner than you think, I shall have the joy of\\\\r\\\\n    beholding once more the lady whose image has ever reigned\\\\r\\\\n    supreme in my heart.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Believe, ch\\\\xc3\\\\xa8re madame, all the assurances of my most devoted\\\\r\\\\n    and unaltered sentiments\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                        \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Armand de la Rochefour.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot handed the letter back to Halliday with a bow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy, monsieur, that you did not know that your daughter intended\\\\r\\\\nrenewing her acquaintance with the Count de la Rochefour?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt came as a thunderbolt to me! I found this letter in my daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nhandbag. As you probably know, Monsieur Poirot, this so-called count\\\\r\\\\nis an adventurer of the worst type.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot nodded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what I want to know is how you knew of the existence of this\\\\r\\\\nletter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend smiled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMonsieur, I did not. But to track footmarks, and\\\\r\\\\nrecognize cigarette-ash is not sufficient for a detective. He must\\\\r\\\\nalso be a good psychologist! I knew that you disliked and mistrusted\\\\r\\\\nyour son-in-law. He benefits by your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death; the maid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ndescription of the mysterious man bears a sufficient resemblance to\\\\r\\\\nhim. Yet you are not keen on his track! Why? Surely because your\\\\r\\\\nsuspicions lie in another direction. Therefore you were keeping\\\\r\\\\nsomething back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right, Monsieur Poirot. I was sure of Rupert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guilt until I\\\\r\\\\nfound this letter. It unsettled me horribly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. The Count says: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Before very long, and perhaps sooner than you\\\\r\\\\nthink.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Obviously he would not want to wait until you should get wind\\\\r\\\\nof his reappearance. Was it he who traveled down from London by the\\\\r\\\\ntwelve-fourteen, and came along the corridor to your daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ncompartment? The Count de la Rochefour is also, if I remember rightly,\\\\r\\\\ntall and dark!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe millionaire nodded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, monsieur, I will wish you good day. Scotland Yard, has, I\\\\r\\\\npresume, a list of the jewels?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I believe Inspector Japp is here now if you would like to see\\\\r\\\\nhim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJapp was an old friend of ours, and greeted Poirot with a sort of\\\\r\\\\naffectionate contempt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how are you, monsieur? No bad feeling between us, though we\\\\r\\\\n_have_ got our different ways of looking at things. How are the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98little gray cells,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 eh? Going strong?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot beamed upon him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey function, my good Japp; assuredly they\\\\r\\\\ndo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right. Think it was the Honorable Rupert, or a crook?\\\\r\\\\nWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keeping an eye on all the regular places, of course. We shall\\\\r\\\\nknow if the shiners are disposed of, and of course whoever did it\\\\r\\\\nisn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to keep them to admire their sparkle. Not likely! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\r\\\\ntrying to find out where Rupert Carrington was yesterday. Seems a bit\\\\r\\\\nof a mystery about it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a man watching him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA great precaution, but perhaps a day late,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d suggested Poirot gently.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou always will have your joke, Monsieur Poirot. Well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m off to\\\\r\\\\nPaddington. Bristol, Weston, Taunton, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s my beat. So long.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will come round and see me this evening, and tell me the result?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSure thing, if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat good Inspector believes in matter in motion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Poirot as\\\\r\\\\nour friend departed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe travels; he measures footprints; he collects\\\\r\\\\nmud and cigarette-ash! He is extremely busy! He is zealous beyond\\\\r\\\\nwords! And if I mentioned psychology to him, do you know what he would\\\\r\\\\ndo, my friend? He would smile! He would say to himself: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Poor old\\\\r\\\\nPoirot! He ages! He grows senile!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Japp is the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98younger generation\\\\r\\\\nknocking on the door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 And _ma foi!_ They are so busy knocking that\\\\r\\\\nthey do not notice that the door is open!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what are you going to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs we have _carte blanche_, I shall expend threepence in ringing up\\\\r\\\\nthe Ritz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94where you may have noticed our Count is staying. After that,\\\\r\\\\nas my feet are a little damp, and I have sneezed twice, I shall return\\\\r\\\\nto my rooms and make myself a _tisano_ over the spirit lamp!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI did not see Poirot again until the following morning. I found him\\\\r\\\\nplacidly finishing his breakfast.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I inquired eagerly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat has happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Japp?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have not seen him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Count?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe left the Ritz the day before yesterday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe day of the murder?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that settles it! Rupert Carrington is cleared.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause the Count de la Rochefour has left the Ritz? You go too fast,\\\\r\\\\nmy friend.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, he must be followed, arrested! But what could be his motive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne hundred thousand dollars\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worth of jewelry is a very good motive\\\\r\\\\nfor anyone. No, the question to my mind is: why kill her? Why not\\\\r\\\\nsimply steal the jewels? She would not prosecute.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause she is a woman, _mon ami_. She once loved this man. Therefore\\\\r\\\\nshe would suffer her loss in silence. And the Count, who is an\\\\r\\\\nextremely good psychologist where women are concerned,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94hence his\\\\r\\\\nsuccesses,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94would know that perfectly well! On the other hand, if\\\\r\\\\nRupert Carrington killed her, why take the jewels, which would\\\\r\\\\nincriminate him fatally?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs a blind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps you are right, my friend. Ah, here is Japp! I recognize his\\\\r\\\\nknock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Inspector was beaming good-humoredly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMorning, Poirot. Only just got back. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done some good work! And\\\\r\\\\nyou?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe, I have arranged my ideas,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied Poirot placidly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJapp laughed heartily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOld chap\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s getting on in years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he observed beneath his breath to\\\\r\\\\nme. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat wont do for us young folk,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said aloud.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Quel dommage?_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot inquired.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, do you want to hear what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou permit me to make a guess? You have found the knife with which\\\\r\\\\nthe crime was committed by the side of the line between Weston and\\\\r\\\\nTaunton, and you have interviewed the paper-boy who spoke to Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nCarrington at Weston!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJapp\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaw fell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow on earth did you know? Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me it was\\\\r\\\\nthose almighty \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98little gray cells\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of yours!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad you admit for once that they are _all mighty_! Tell me, did\\\\r\\\\nshe give the paper-boy a shilling for himself?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it was half a crown!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Japp recovered his temper and grinned.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPretty extravagant, these rich Americans!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd in consequence the boy did not forget her?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot he. Half-crowns don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come his way every day. She hailed him and\\\\r\\\\nbought two magazines. One had a picture of a girl in blue on the\\\\r\\\\ncover. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll match me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she said. Oh! he remembered her perfectly.\\\\r\\\\nWell, that was enough for me. By the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s evidence, the crime\\\\r\\\\n_must_ have been committed before Taunton. I guessed they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d throw the\\\\r\\\\nknife away at once, and I walked down the line looking for it; and\\\\r\\\\nsure enough, there it was. I made inquiries at Taunton about our man,\\\\r\\\\nbut of course it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a big station, and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t likely they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d notice\\\\r\\\\nhim. He probably got back to London by a later train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot nodded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery likely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I found another bit of news when I got back. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re passing the\\\\r\\\\njewels, all right! That large emerald was pawned last night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94by one of\\\\r\\\\nthe regular lot. Who do you think it was?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94except that he was a short man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJapp stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right there. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s short enough. It was Red\\\\r\\\\nNarky.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho on earth is Red Narky?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA particularly sharp jewel-thief, sir. And not one to stick at\\\\r\\\\nmurder. Usually works with a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Gracie Kidd; but she doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem\\\\r\\\\nto be in it this time\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94unless she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got off to Holland with the rest of\\\\r\\\\nthe swag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve arrested Narky?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSure thing. But mind you, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the other man we want\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the man who went\\\\r\\\\ndown with Mrs. Carrington in the train. He was the one who planned the\\\\r\\\\njob, right enough. But Narky wont squeal on a pal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI noticed that Poirot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes had become very green.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said gently, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I can find Narky\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pal for you, all\\\\r\\\\nright.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of your little ideas, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Japp eyed Poirot sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonderful\\\\r\\\\nhow you manage to deliver the goods sometimes, at your age and all.\\\\r\\\\nDevil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own luck, of course.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps, perhaps,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured my friend. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHastings, my hat. And the\\\\r\\\\nbrush. So! My galoshes if it still rains! We must not undo the good\\\\r\\\\nwork of that _tisano_. Au revoir, Japp!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck to you, Poirot.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot hailed the first taxi we met, and directed the driver to Park\\\\r\\\\nLane.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen we drew up before Halliday\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house, he skipped out nimbly, paid\\\\r\\\\nthe driver and rang the bell. To the footman who opened the door he\\\\r\\\\nmade a request in a low voice, and we were immediately taken upstairs.\\\\r\\\\nWe went up to the top of the house, and were shown into a small neat\\\\r\\\\nbedroom.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes roved round the room and fastened themselves on a small\\\\r\\\\nblack trunk. He knelt in front of it, scrutinized the labels on it,\\\\r\\\\nand took a small twist of wire from his pocket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAsk Mr. Halliday if he will be so kind as to mount to me here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nsaid over his shoulder to the footman.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(It is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story at\\\\r\\\\nthis point, make his own solution of the mystery\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and then see how\\\\r\\\\nclose he comes to that of the author.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94The Editors.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man departed, and Poirot gently coaxed the lock of the trunk with\\\\r\\\\na practiced hand. In a few minutes the lock gave, and he raised the\\\\r\\\\nlid of the trunk. Swiftly he began rummaging among the clothes it\\\\r\\\\ncontained, flinging them out on the floor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was a heavy step on the stairs, and Halliday entered the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat in hell are you doing here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he demanded, staring.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was looking, monsieur, for _this_.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot withdrew from the trunk\\\\r\\\\na coat and skirt of bright blue frieze, and a small toque of white fox\\\\r\\\\nfur.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing with my trunk?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I turned to see that the maid,\\\\r\\\\nJane Mason, had just entered the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you will just shut the door, Hastings. Thank you. Yes, and stand\\\\r\\\\nwith your back against it. Now, Mr. Halliday, let me introduce you to\\\\r\\\\nGrace Kidd, otherwise Jane Mason, who will shortly rejoin her\\\\r\\\\naccomplice, Red Narky, under the kind escort of Japp.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was of the most simple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Poirot waved a deprecating hand, then\\\\r\\\\nhelped himself to more caviare. It is not every day that one lunches\\\\r\\\\nwith a millionaire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was the maid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s insistence on the clothes that her mistress was\\\\r\\\\nwearing that first struck me. Why was she so anxious that our\\\\r\\\\nattention should be directed to them? I reflected that we had only the\\\\r\\\\nmaid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s word for the mysterious man in the carriage at Bristol. As far\\\\r\\\\nas the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s evidence went, Mrs. Carrington might easily have been\\\\r\\\\nmurdered _before_ reaching Bristol. But if so, then the maid must be\\\\r\\\\nan accomplice. And if she were an accomplice, she would not wish this\\\\r\\\\npoint to rest on her evidence alone. The clothes Mrs. Carrington was\\\\r\\\\nwearing were of a striking nature. A maid usually has a good deal of\\\\r\\\\nchoice as to what her mistress shall wear. Now if, after Bristol,\\\\r\\\\nanyone saw a lady in a bright blue coat and skirt, and a fur toque, he\\\\r\\\\nwill be quite ready to swear he has seen Mrs. Carrington.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI began to reconstruct. The maid would provide herself with duplicate\\\\r\\\\nclothes. She and her accomplice chloroform and stab Mrs. Carrington\\\\r\\\\nbetween London and Bristol, probably taking advantage of a tunnel. Her\\\\r\\\\nbody is rolled under the seat; the maid takes her place. At Weston she\\\\r\\\\nmust make herself noticed. How? In all probability, a newspaper-boy\\\\r\\\\nwill be selected. She will insure his remembering her by giving him a\\\\r\\\\nlarge tip. She also drew his attention to the color of her dress by a\\\\r\\\\nremark about one of the magazines. After leaving Weston, she throws\\\\r\\\\nthe knife out of the window to mark the place where the crime\\\\r\\\\npresumably occurred, and changes her clothes, or buttons a long\\\\r\\\\nmackintosh over them. At Taunton she leaves the train and returns to\\\\r\\\\nBristol as soon as possible, where her accomplice has duly left the\\\\r\\\\nluggage in the cloak-room. He hands over the ticket and himself\\\\r\\\\nreturns to London. She waits on the platform, carrying out her r\\\\xc3\\\\xb4le,\\\\r\\\\ngoes to a hotel for the night and returns to town in the morning\\\\r\\\\nexactly as she said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Japp returned from his expedition, he confirmed all my\\\\r\\\\ndeductions. He also told me that a well-known crook was passing the\\\\r\\\\njewels. I knew that whoever it was would be the exact opposite of the\\\\r\\\\nman Jane Mason described. When I heard that it was Red Narky, who\\\\r\\\\nalways worked with Gracie Kidd\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94well, I knew just where to find her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the Count?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe more I thought of it, the more I was convinced that he had\\\\r\\\\nnothing to do with it. That gentleman is much too careful of his own\\\\r\\\\nskin to risk murder. It would be out of keeping with his character.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Monsieur Poirot,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Halliday. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI owe you a big debt. And the\\\\r\\\\ncheck I write after lunch wont go near to settling it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPoirot smiled modestly, and murmured to me: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe good Japp, he shall\\\\r\\\\nget the official credit, all right, but though he has got his Gracie\\\\r\\\\nKidd, I think that I, as the Americans say, have got his goat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Transcriber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Note: This story appeared in the January 1924\\\\r\\\\nissue of The Blue Book Magazine.]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PLYMOUTH EXPRESS\\\\r\\\\nAFFAIR ***\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\\\r\\\\nbe renamed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\\\r\\\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\\\r\\\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\\\r\\\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\\\r\\\\nroyalties.

I have seldom heard\\\\r\\\\nhim mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\\\r\\\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\\\r\\\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\\\r\\\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He\\\\r\\\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\\\r\\\\nthe world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a\\\\r\\\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\\\r\\\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94excellent\\\\r\\\\nfor drawing the veil from men\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s motives and actions. But for the\\\\r\\\\ntrained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and\\\\r\\\\nfinely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which\\\\r\\\\nmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\\\r\\\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\\\r\\\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\\\r\\\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\\\r\\\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\\\r\\\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\\\r\\\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\\\r\\\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention;\\\\r\\\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole\\\\r\\\\nBohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among\\\\r\\\\nhis old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and\\\\r\\\\nambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his\\\\r\\\\nown keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study\\\\r\\\\nof crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers\\\\r\\\\nof observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\\\r\\\\nmysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\\\r\\\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\\\r\\\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing\\\\r\\\\nup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,\\\\r\\\\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\\\r\\\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\\\r\\\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\\\r\\\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it was on the 20th of March, 1888\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I was returning from a\\\\r\\\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\\\r\\\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\\\r\\\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\\\r\\\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\\\r\\\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\\\r\\\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\\\r\\\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\\\r\\\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\\\r\\\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\\\r\\\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\\\r\\\\nstory. He was at work again. He had arisen out of his drug-created\\\\r\\\\ndreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\\\\r\\\\nbell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part\\\\r\\\\nmy own.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\\\r\\\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\\\r\\\\nme to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\\\r\\\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the\\\\r\\\\nfire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWedlock suits you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Watson, that you have put\\\\r\\\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeven!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\\\r\\\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\\\r\\\\nthat you intended to go into harness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, how do you know?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\\\r\\\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\\\r\\\\nservant girl?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is too much. You would certainly have\\\\r\\\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had\\\\r\\\\na country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I\\\\r\\\\nhave changed my clothes, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\\\r\\\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there,\\\\r\\\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is simplicity itself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy eyes tell me that on the\\\\r\\\\ninside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the\\\\r\\\\nleather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have\\\\r\\\\nbeen caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the\\\\r\\\\nedges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you\\\\r\\\\nsee, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and\\\\r\\\\nthat you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\\\\r\\\\nLondon slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms\\\\r\\\\nsmelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his\\\\r\\\\nright forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where\\\\r\\\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\\\r\\\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\\\r\\\\nprocess of deduction. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\\\r\\\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\\\r\\\\nreasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I\\\\r\\\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\\\r\\\\ndown into an arm-chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, but you do not observe. The\\\\r\\\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\\\r\\\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrequently.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow often?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, some hundreds of times.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen how many are there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow many? I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\\\r\\\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\\\r\\\\nboth seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these\\\\r\\\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\\\r\\\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He threw\\\\r\\\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open\\\\r\\\\nupon the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt came by the last post,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRead it aloud.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nit said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the\\\\r\\\\nvery deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses\\\\r\\\\nof Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\\\r\\\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\\\r\\\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\\\r\\\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\\\r\\\\nwear a mask.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is indeed a mystery,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you imagine that it\\\\r\\\\nmeans?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has\\\\r\\\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\\\r\\\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\\\r\\\\nit?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\\\r\\\\nwritten.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked,\\\\r\\\\nendeavoring to imitate my companion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s processes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSuch paper could not\\\\r\\\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\\\r\\\\nstiff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeculiar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is the very word,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is not an English\\\\r\\\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI did so, and saw a large _E_ with a small _g_, a _P_, and a large _G_\\\\r\\\\nwith a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you make of that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. The _G_ with the small _t_ stands for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Gesellschaft,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nwhich is the German for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Company.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 It is a customary contraction like\\\\r\\\\nour \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Co.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 _P_, of course, stands for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Papier.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Now for the _Eg_. Let us\\\\r\\\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took down a heavy brown volume\\\\r\\\\nfrom his shelves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEglow, Eglonitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94here we are, Egria. It is in a\\\\r\\\\nGerman-speaking country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Remarkable\\\\r\\\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\\\r\\\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\\\r\\\\nthat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\\\r\\\\nfrom his cigarette.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\\\r\\\\npeculiar construction of the sentence\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This account of you we have\\\\r\\\\nfrom all quarters received.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 A Frenchman or Russian could not have\\\\r\\\\nwritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It\\\\r\\\\nonly remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German\\\\r\\\\nwho writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing\\\\r\\\\nhis face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\\\r\\\\ndoubts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 hoofs and grating\\\\r\\\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\\\\r\\\\nwhistled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA pair, by the sound,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, glancing out of\\\\r\\\\nthe window. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\\\\r\\\\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s money in this case, Watson, if there\\\\r\\\\nis nothing else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\\\\r\\\\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut your client\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\\\\r\\\\nSit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\\\r\\\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\\\r\\\\nauthoritative tap.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome in!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA MAN ENTERED\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\\\r\\\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\\\\r\\\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\\\r\\\\ntaste. Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\\\r\\\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which\\\\r\\\\nwas thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and\\\\r\\\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\\\r\\\\nberyl. Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were\\\\r\\\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\\\r\\\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\\\\r\\\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\\\r\\\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\\\r\\\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\\\r\\\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\\\\r\\\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging\\\\r\\\\nlip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the\\\\r\\\\nlength of obstinacy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had my note?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\\\r\\\\nmarked German accent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI told you that I would call.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked from\\\\r\\\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take a seat,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\\\r\\\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\\\r\\\\nhave I the honor to address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\\\\r\\\\nI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor\\\\r\\\\nand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\\\r\\\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\\\r\\\\nmy chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is both, or none,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may say before this\\\\r\\\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe count shrugged his broad shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I must begin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of\\\\r\\\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\\\\r\\\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\\\r\\\\nEuropean history.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI promise,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse this mask,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued our strange visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe august\\\\r\\\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\\\r\\\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\\\r\\\\nnot exactly my own.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was aware of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, dryly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has\\\\r\\\\nto be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\\\r\\\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\\\\r\\\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\\\r\\\\nkings of Bohemia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was also aware of that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\\\r\\\\nhis arm-chair and closing his eyes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\\\r\\\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as\\\\r\\\\nthe most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\\\r\\\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\r\\\\nshould be better able to advise you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\\\r\\\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\\\r\\\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nhe cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, indeed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour Majesty had not spoken before\\\\r\\\\nI was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\\\r\\\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\\\r\\\\nBohemia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you can understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\\\r\\\\nmore and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou can\\\\r\\\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\\\r\\\\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\\\r\\\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\\\\r\\\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, pray consult,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\\\r\\\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\\\\r\\\\nadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKindly look her up in my index, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes, without\\\\r\\\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\\\r\\\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult\\\\r\\\\nto name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\\\r\\\\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\\\r\\\\nthat of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\\\r\\\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me see!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year\\\\r\\\\n1858. Contralto\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\\\\r\\\\nWarsaw\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Yes! Retired from operatic stage\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ha! Living in London\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94quite\\\\r\\\\nso! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young\\\\r\\\\nperson, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\\\r\\\\ngetting those letters back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so. But how\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas there a secret marriage?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo legal papers or certificates?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\\\r\\\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\\\r\\\\nprove their authenticity?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is the writing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy private note-paper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStolen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy own seal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cImitated.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBought.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe were both in the photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\\\r\\\\nindiscretion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was mad\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94insane.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must be recovered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have tried and failed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe will not sell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStolen, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\\\r\\\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\\\r\\\\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo sign of it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut a very serious one to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d returned the King, reproachfully.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo ruin me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am about to be married.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I have heard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\\\r\\\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\\\r\\\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\\\r\\\\nwould bring the matter to an end.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd Irene Adler?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\\\r\\\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\\\\r\\\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\\\r\\\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are\\\\r\\\\nno lengths to which she would not go\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\\\r\\\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, then, we have three days yet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, with a yawn. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is\\\\r\\\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\\\r\\\\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\\\r\\\\npresent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the\\\\r\\\\nCount Von Kramm.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, as to money?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have _carte blanche_.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\\\r\\\\nhave that photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd for present expenses?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\\\r\\\\nit on the table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nsaid.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\\\r\\\\nto him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd mademoiselle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wood.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes took a note of it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne other question,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas the\\\\r\\\\nphotograph a cabinet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\\\r\\\\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added, as the\\\\r\\\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you will be\\\\r\\\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, I should\\\\r\\\\nlike to chat this little matter over with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nII\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt three o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\\\r\\\\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\\\r\\\\nshortly after eight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\\\\r\\\\nfire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he\\\\r\\\\nmight be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though\\\\r\\\\nit was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which\\\\r\\\\nwere associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,\\\\r\\\\nstill, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client\\\\r\\\\ngave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\\\r\\\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\\\r\\\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\\\r\\\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\\\r\\\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\\\r\\\\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\\\r\\\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\\\r\\\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\\\r\\\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to\\\\r\\\\nmy friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look\\\\r\\\\nthree times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod\\\\r\\\\nhe vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\\\r\\\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\\\r\\\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed\\\\r\\\\nheartily for some minutes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, really!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until\\\\r\\\\nhe was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\\\r\\\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\\\r\\\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\\\\r\\\\nI left the house a little after eight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock this morning, in the\\\\r\\\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\\\r\\\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\\\\r\\\\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\\\\r\\\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\\\r\\\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\\\\r\\\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\\\r\\\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\\\r\\\\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\\\r\\\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it\\\\r\\\\nand examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\\\r\\\\nanything else of interest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there\\\\r\\\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\\\\r\\\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in\\\\r\\\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\\\r\\\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\\\r\\\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom I was\\\\r\\\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\\\r\\\\nlisten to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what of Irene Adler?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, she has turned all the men\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heads down in that part. She\\\\r\\\\nis the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\\\r\\\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\\\r\\\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\\\\r\\\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\\\\r\\\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\\\r\\\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\\\r\\\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\\\r\\\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\\\r\\\\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all that they had to\\\\r\\\\ntell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to\\\\r\\\\nthink over my plan of campaign.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the\\\\r\\\\nmatter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation\\\\r\\\\nbetween them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she\\\\r\\\\nhis client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had\\\\r\\\\nprobably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,\\\\r\\\\nit was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I\\\\r\\\\nshould continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\\\r\\\\ngentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\\\r\\\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\\\r\\\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\\\r\\\\nto understand the situation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am following you closely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove\\\\r\\\\nup to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\\\r\\\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94evidently the man of whom\\\\r\\\\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\\\r\\\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\\\r\\\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\\\r\\\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\\\r\\\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\\\\r\\\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up\\\\r\\\\nto the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\\\r\\\\nearnestly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Drive like the devil,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98first to Gross &\\\\r\\\\nHankey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Regent Street, and then to the church of St. Monica in the\\\\r\\\\nEdgware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\\\\r\\\\nwell to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the\\\\r\\\\ncoachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,\\\\r\\\\nwhile all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It\\\\r\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I\\\\r\\\\nonly caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman,\\\\r\\\\nwith a face that a man might die for.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Church of St. Monica, John,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and half a sovereign if\\\\r\\\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\\\r\\\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau,\\\\r\\\\nwhen a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a\\\\r\\\\nshabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Church of\\\\r\\\\nSt. Monica,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\\\r\\\\nminutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\\\r\\\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy cabby drove fast. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\\\r\\\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\\\r\\\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\\\r\\\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\\\r\\\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\\\r\\\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\\\r\\\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\\\r\\\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\\\r\\\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do. Come! Come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be legal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I\\\\r\\\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\\\r\\\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting\\\\r\\\\nin the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\\\r\\\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\\\r\\\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\\\r\\\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\\\r\\\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of\\\\r\\\\nit that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been\\\\r\\\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely\\\\r\\\\nrefused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\\\r\\\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\\\r\\\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\\\r\\\\nmean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand what then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\\\r\\\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\\\r\\\\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\\\r\\\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\r\\\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she said, as she left\\\\r\\\\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\\\\r\\\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich are?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, ringing the bell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\r\\\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\\\r\\\\nthis evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall be delighted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind breaking the law?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot in the least.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNor running a chance of arrest?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot in a good cause.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, the cause is excellent!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I am your man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was sure that I might rely on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what is it you wish?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\\\\r\\\\nyou. Now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\\\r\\\\nlandlady had provided, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\\\r\\\\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\\\\r\\\\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\\\r\\\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\\\r\\\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\\\\r\\\\ncome what may. You understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am to be neutral?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\\\r\\\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\\\\r\\\\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\\\r\\\\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd when I raise my hand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94so\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you will throw into the room what I give\\\\r\\\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\\\\r\\\\nquite follow me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEntirely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is nothing very formidable,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\\\r\\\\nroll from his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is an ordinary plumber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smoke-rocket,\\\\r\\\\nfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\\\r\\\\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken\\\\r\\\\nup by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\\\\r\\\\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\\\r\\\\nmyself clear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at\\\\r\\\\nthe signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\\\r\\\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you may entirely rely on me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\\\r\\\\nfor the new role I have to play.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the\\\\r\\\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\\\r\\\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\\\r\\\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\\\r\\\\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\\\\r\\\\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\\\r\\\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\\\\r\\\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\\\r\\\\nspecialist in crime.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\\\r\\\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\\\r\\\\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\\\r\\\\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\\\r\\\\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s succinct description, but the locality appeared to\\\\r\\\\nbe less private that I expected. On the contrary, for a small street\\\\r\\\\nin a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a\\\\r\\\\ngroup of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\\\r\\\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\\\r\\\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\\\r\\\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\\\r\\\\nhouse, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\\\\r\\\\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\\\\r\\\\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\\\\r\\\\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\\\\r\\\\nthe photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere, indeed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\\\r\\\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dress. She knows\\\\r\\\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\\\r\\\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\\\\r\\\\nshe does not carry it about with her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\\\r\\\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\\\r\\\\nlike to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to any one\\\\r\\\\nelse? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell\\\\r\\\\nwhat indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\\\r\\\\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\\\r\\\\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\\\\r\\\\nin her own house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it has twice been burgled.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how will you look?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will not look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will get her to show me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut she will refuse.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\\\r\\\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the\\\\r\\\\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\\\r\\\\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\\\r\\\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\\\r\\\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\\\r\\\\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\\\r\\\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\\\r\\\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\\\r\\\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\\\r\\\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\\\r\\\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\\\r\\\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her\\\\r\\\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\\\r\\\\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\\\r\\\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\\\r\\\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\\\r\\\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\\\\r\\\\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\\\r\\\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\\\r\\\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is dead,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried several voices.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life in him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted another. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be gone\\\\r\\\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a brave fellow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a woman. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey would have had the lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\npurse and watch if it hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\\\r\\\\nrough one, too. Ah, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s breathing now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\\\r\\\\nThis way, please!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\\\r\\\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post\\\\r\\\\nby the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been\\\\r\\\\ndrawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not\\\\r\\\\nknow whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part\\\\r\\\\nhe was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\\\\r\\\\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom\\\\r\\\\nI was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\\\\r\\\\nupon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to\\\\r\\\\nHolmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.\\\\r\\\\nI hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.\\\\r\\\\nAfter all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing\\\\r\\\\nher from injuring another.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\\\r\\\\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\\\r\\\\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed\\\\r\\\\nmy rocket into the room with a cry of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFire!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The word was no sooner\\\\r\\\\nout of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\\\r\\\\nill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94joined in a general shriek\\\\r\\\\nof \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFire!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at\\\\r\\\\nthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment\\\\r\\\\nlater the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\\\r\\\\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\\\r\\\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm\\\\r\\\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\\\\r\\\\nand in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of\\\\r\\\\nthe quiet streets which lead towards the Edgware Road.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did it very nicely, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing could have been\\\\r\\\\nbetter. It is all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have the photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know where it is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how did you find out?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe showed me, as I told you that she would.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am still in the dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not wish to make a mystery,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe matter was\\\\r\\\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that every one in the street was\\\\r\\\\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI guessed as much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\\\r\\\\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\\\r\\\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat also I could fathom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\\\r\\\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\\\r\\\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined\\\\r\\\\nto see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\\\\r\\\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did that help you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\\\r\\\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\\\r\\\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\\\r\\\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\\\r\\\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\\\r\\\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\\\r\\\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\\\r\\\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\\\r\\\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\\\r\\\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\\\r\\\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\\\r\\\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\\\r\\\\nshe half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\\\r\\\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\\\r\\\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\\\r\\\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\\\r\\\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\\\r\\\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\\\r\\\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\\\\r\\\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\\\r\\\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\\\\r\\\\na satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd when will you call?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\\\r\\\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\\\r\\\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\\\\r\\\\ndelay.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was\\\\r\\\\nsearching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\\\r\\\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard that voice before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, staring down the dimly-lit\\\\r\\\\nstreet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIII\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\\\r\\\\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have really got it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\\\\r\\\\nshoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you have hopes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have hopes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must have a cab.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, my brougham is waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that will simplify matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d We descended, and started off once\\\\r\\\\nmore for Briony Lodge.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIrene Adler is married,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMarried! When?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYesterday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut to whom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut she could not love him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am in hopes that she does.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why in hopes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\\\r\\\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\\\\r\\\\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\\\r\\\\nyour Majesty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plan.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is true. And yet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What\\\\r\\\\na queen she would have made!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He relapsed into a moody silence, which\\\\r\\\\nwas not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon\\\\r\\\\nthe steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\\\r\\\\nbrougham.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered my companion, looking at her with a\\\\r\\\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\\\r\\\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for\\\\r\\\\nthe Continent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\\\r\\\\nsurprise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you mean that she has left England?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever to return.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the papers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked the King, hoarsely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll is lost.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\\\r\\\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\\\r\\\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\\\r\\\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter,\\\\r\\\\nand, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\\\\r\\\\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\\\r\\\\nsuperscribed to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d My\\\\r\\\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\\\r\\\\nmidnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94You really did it very\\\\r\\\\n  well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of\\\\r\\\\n  fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had\\\\r\\\\n  betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against\\\\r\\\\n  you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an\\\\r\\\\n  agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been\\\\r\\\\n  given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you\\\\r\\\\n  wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard\\\\r\\\\n  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you\\\\r\\\\n  know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume\\\\r\\\\n  is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom\\\\r\\\\n  which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran\\\\r\\\\n  up-stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and\\\\r\\\\n  came down just as you departed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\\\r\\\\n  really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock\\\\r\\\\n  Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\\\\r\\\\n  started for the Temple to see my husband.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\\\r\\\\n  so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty\\\\r\\\\n  when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may\\\\r\\\\n  rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he.\\\\r\\\\n  The King may do what he will without hinderance from one whom\\\\r\\\\n  he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself,\\\\r\\\\n  and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any\\\\r\\\\n  steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph\\\\r\\\\n  which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock\\\\r\\\\n  Holmes, very truly yours,      IRENE NORTON, _n\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e_ ADLER.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94oh, what a woman!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the King of Bohemia, when we\\\\r\\\\nhad all three read this epistle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid I not tell you how quick and\\\\r\\\\nresolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not\\\\r\\\\na pity that she was not on my level?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\\\r\\\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, coldly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sorry\\\\r\\\\nthat I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business to a more\\\\r\\\\nsuccessful conclusion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the King; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnothing could be more\\\\r\\\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\\\\r\\\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\\\r\\\\nyou. This ring\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\\\r\\\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have but to name it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis photograph!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIrene\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s photograph!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, if you wish it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\\\r\\\\nI have the honor to wish you a very good-morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He bowed, and,\\\\r\\\\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\\\\r\\\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\\\r\\\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by\\\\r\\\\na woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but\\\\r\\\\nI have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler,\\\\r\\\\nor when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable\\\\r\\\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure II\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn\\\\r\\\\nof last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout,\\\\r\\\\nflorid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology\\\\r\\\\nfor my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me\\\\r\\\\nabruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nsaid, cordially.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was afraid that you were engaged.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I am. Very much so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I can wait in the next room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\\\r\\\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\\\\r\\\\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\\\r\\\\ngreeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small,\\\\r\\\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTry the settee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting\\\\r\\\\nhis finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\r\\\\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\\\\r\\\\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. You have\\\\r\\\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\\\\r\\\\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\\\\r\\\\nso many of my own little adventures.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\r\\\\nobserved.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\\\r\\\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\\\r\\\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to\\\\r\\\\nlife itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\\\r\\\\nimagination.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,\\\\r\\\\nfor otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your\\\\r\\\\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\\\\r\\\\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\\\\r\\\\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that\\\\r\\\\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\\\\r\\\\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\\\\r\\\\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\\\r\\\\nAs far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the\\\\r\\\\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\\\r\\\\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\\\r\\\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\\\\r\\\\nyour narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has\\\\r\\\\nnot heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the\\\\r\\\\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\\\r\\\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\\\\r\\\\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\\\\r\\\\ncases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\\\r\\\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\\\r\\\\nlittle pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\\\\r\\\\npocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,\\\\r\\\\nwith his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his\\\\r\\\\nknee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion\\\\r\\\\nof my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by\\\\r\\\\nhis dress or appearance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\\\r\\\\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\\\r\\\\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s check trousers,\\\\r\\\\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\\\\r\\\\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\\\\r\\\\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\\\\r\\\\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\\\r\\\\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\\\\r\\\\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\\\r\\\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his\\\\r\\\\nhead with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBeyond the\\\\r\\\\nobvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes\\\\r\\\\nsnuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he\\\\r\\\\nhas done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing\\\\r\\\\nelse.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\\\\r\\\\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nhe asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labor. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nas true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s carpenter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\\\r\\\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\\\r\\\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\\\r\\\\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\\\r\\\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\\\r\\\\nrest it upon the desk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, but China?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\\\r\\\\ncould only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo\\\\r\\\\nmarks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.\\\\r\\\\nThat trick of staining the fishes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 scales of a delicate pink is quite\\\\r\\\\npeculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\\\\r\\\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I never!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought\\\\r\\\\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\\\\r\\\\nnothing in it, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI begin to think, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I make a mistake in\\\\r\\\\nexplaining. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you know, and my poor little\\\\r\\\\nreputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can\\\\r\\\\nyou not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I have got it now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, with his thick, red finger\\\\r\\\\nplanted half-way down the column. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere it is. This is what began it\\\\r\\\\nall. You just read it for yourself, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI took the paper from him, and read as follows:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the\\\\r\\\\n  late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now\\\\r\\\\n  another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League\\\\r\\\\n  to a salary of \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a week for purely nominal services. All\\\\r\\\\n  red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above\\\\r\\\\n  the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on\\\\r\\\\n  Monday, at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of\\\\r\\\\n  the League, 7 Pope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Court, Fleet Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth does this mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated, after I had twice read\\\\r\\\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\\\r\\\\nhigh spirits. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nhe. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about\\\\r\\\\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\\\r\\\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper\\\\r\\\\nand the date.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have a small pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the city. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a very large affair,\\\\r\\\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I\\\\r\\\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\\\\r\\\\nwould have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half\\\\r\\\\nwages, so as to learn the business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Sherlock Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not such a youth, either. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nhard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;\\\\r\\\\nand I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what\\\\r\\\\nI am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\\\\r\\\\nput ideas in his head?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employ\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_ who\\\\r\\\\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\\\r\\\\nemployers in this age. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that your assistant is not as\\\\r\\\\nremarkable as your advertisement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, he has his faults, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Wilson. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever was such a fellow\\\\r\\\\nfor photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\\\r\\\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\\\\r\\\\ninto its hole to develope his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on\\\\r\\\\nthe whole, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a good worker. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no vice in him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is still with you, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking,\\\\r\\\\nand keeps the place clean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all I have in the house, for I am a\\\\r\\\\nwidower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three\\\\r\\\\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do\\\\r\\\\nnothing more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\\\r\\\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\\\\r\\\\npaper in his hand, and he says:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another vacancy on the League of the\\\\r\\\\nRed-headed Men. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\\\r\\\\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\\\\r\\\\nso that the trustees are at their wits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end what to do with the money.\\\\r\\\\nIf my hair would only change color, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a nice little crib all ready\\\\r\\\\nfor me to step into.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, what is it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\\\r\\\\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having\\\\r\\\\nto go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\\\r\\\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know much of what was going on outside,\\\\r\\\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked,\\\\r\\\\nwith his eyes open.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Never.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\\\r\\\\nvacancies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And what are they worth?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\\\\r\\\\nneed not interfere very much with one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other occupations.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\\\r\\\\nbusiness has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of\\\\r\\\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell me all about it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, showing me the advertisement, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you can see for\\\\r\\\\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\\\\r\\\\nwhere you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\\\r\\\\nLeague was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who\\\\r\\\\nwas very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a\\\\r\\\\ngreat sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found\\\\r\\\\nthat he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\\\r\\\\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\\\r\\\\nmen whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay,\\\\r\\\\nand very little to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\\\r\\\\napply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Not so many as you might think,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You see it is really\\\\r\\\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from\\\\r\\\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\\\r\\\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\\\\r\\\\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\\\r\\\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;\\\\r\\\\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\\\\r\\\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\\\r\\\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if\\\\r\\\\nthere was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance\\\\r\\\\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\\\\r\\\\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\\\\r\\\\nhim to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.\\\\r\\\\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and\\\\r\\\\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\\\r\\\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\\\r\\\\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\\\r\\\\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Court looked\\\\r\\\\nlike a coster\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were\\\\r\\\\nso many in the whole country as were brought together by that single\\\\r\\\\nadvertisement. Every shade of color they were\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94straw, lemon, orange,\\\\r\\\\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\\\r\\\\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many\\\\r\\\\nwere waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would\\\\r\\\\nnot hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and\\\\r\\\\npulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to\\\\r\\\\nthe steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the\\\\r\\\\nstair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\\\\r\\\\nwedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, as\\\\r\\\\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray continue your very interesting statement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\\\r\\\\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even\\\\r\\\\nredder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came\\\\r\\\\nup, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\\\r\\\\ndisqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\\\\r\\\\nmatter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much\\\\r\\\\nmore favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\\\\r\\\\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said my assistant, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and he is willing to\\\\r\\\\nfill a vacancy in the League.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And he is admirably suited for it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the other answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98He has every\\\\r\\\\nrequirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He\\\\r\\\\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\\\\r\\\\nuntil I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\\\\r\\\\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It would be injustice to hesitate,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You will, however, I am\\\\r\\\\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 With that he seized\\\\r\\\\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There is water in your eyes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, as he released me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I perceive\\\\r\\\\nthat all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\\\\r\\\\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\\\\r\\\\nof cobbler\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He stepped\\\\r\\\\nover to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\\\\r\\\\nthe vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\\\\r\\\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was\\\\r\\\\nnot a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\\\r\\\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\\\\r\\\\nmarried man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI answered that I had not.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis face fell immediately.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dear me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he said, gravely, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\\\r\\\\nto hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\\\r\\\\nand spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\\\r\\\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\\\r\\\\nto have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few\\\\r\\\\nminutes, he said that it would be all right.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98In the case of another,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98the objection might be fatal, but\\\\r\\\\nwe must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as\\\\r\\\\nyours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said Vincent Spaulding. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\r\\\\nshall be able to look after that for you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What would be the hours?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ten to two.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow a pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\\\r\\\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\\\r\\\\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\\\\r\\\\nto anything that turned up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That would suit me very well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And the pay?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a week.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And the work?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is purely nominal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What do you call purely nominal?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\\\\r\\\\nwhole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.\\\\r\\\\nThe will is very clear upon that point. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t comply with the\\\\r\\\\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said\\\\r\\\\nI.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No excuse will avail,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said Mr. Duncan Ross, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98neither sickness nor\\\\r\\\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\\\\r\\\\nbillet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And the work?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is to copy out the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEncyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia Britannica.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There is the first\\\\r\\\\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\\\r\\\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\\\r\\\\nto-morrow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Certainly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\\\r\\\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\\\r\\\\ngain.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant,\\\\r\\\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\\\r\\\\nfortune.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in\\\\r\\\\nlow spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole\\\\r\\\\naffair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might\\\\r\\\\nbe I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that any one\\\\r\\\\ncould make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing\\\\r\\\\nanything so simple as copying out the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia Britannica.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nVincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I\\\\r\\\\nhad reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning\\\\r\\\\nI determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle\\\\r\\\\nof ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\\\r\\\\nstarted off for Pope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Court.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\\\r\\\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to\\\\r\\\\nsee that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and\\\\r\\\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\\\\r\\\\nwas right with me. At two o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\\\\r\\\\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\\\\r\\\\nafter me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\\\r\\\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work.\\\\r\\\\nIt was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning\\\\r\\\\nI was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\\\\r\\\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after\\\\r\\\\na time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\\\\r\\\\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\\\r\\\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\\\\r\\\\nnot risk the loss of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\\\r\\\\nArchery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\\\\r\\\\nthat I might get on to the B\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s before very long. It cost me something\\\\r\\\\nin foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.\\\\r\\\\nAnd then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo an end?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\\\\r\\\\nat ten o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\\\r\\\\nof card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here\\\\r\\\\nit is, and you can read for yourself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of\\\\r\\\\nnote-paper. It read in this fashion:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\\\r\\\\n   IS\\\\r\\\\n   DISSOLVED.\\\\r\\\\n   _October 9, 1890._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\\\r\\\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\\\r\\\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\\\r\\\\nof laughter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried our client,\\\\r\\\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you can do nothing\\\\r\\\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\\\r\\\\nhad half risen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss your case for the world. It is\\\\r\\\\nmost refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\\\r\\\\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you\\\\r\\\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at\\\\r\\\\nthe offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\\\r\\\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\\\r\\\\nground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\\\r\\\\nthe Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\\\\r\\\\nbody. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\\\\r\\\\nname was new to him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98the gentleman at No. 4.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What, the red-headed man?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and\\\\r\\\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\\\r\\\\nwere ready. He moved out yesterday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where could I find him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\\\\r\\\\nEdward Street, near St. Paul\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\\\r\\\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\\\\r\\\\neither Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what did you do then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\\\r\\\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that\\\\r\\\\nif I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\\\\r\\\\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\\\\r\\\\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you did very wisely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour case is an exceedingly\\\\r\\\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\\\r\\\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\\\r\\\\nit than might at first sight appear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGrave enough!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, I have lost four pound a\\\\r\\\\nweek.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs far as you are personally concerned,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not\\\\r\\\\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\\\r\\\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \\\\xc2\\\\xa330, to say\\\\r\\\\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\\\\r\\\\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\\\r\\\\ntheir object was in playing this prank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94if it was a prank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94upon me. It\\\\r\\\\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\\\r\\\\npounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\\\\r\\\\nor two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called\\\\r\\\\nyour attention to the advertisement\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94how long had he been with you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout a month then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did he come?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn answer to an advertisement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas he the only applicant?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I had a dozen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you pick him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause he was handy, and would come cheap.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt half-wages, in fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\\\r\\\\nthough he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\\\r\\\\nforehead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought as\\\\r\\\\nmuch,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\\\r\\\\nearrings?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a\\\\r\\\\nlad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is still with\\\\r\\\\nyou?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, sir; I have only just left him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing to complain of, sir. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never very much to do of a\\\\r\\\\nmorning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\\\r\\\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\\\\r\\\\nhope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat do you\\\\r\\\\nmake of it all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI make nothing of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered, frankly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a most mysterious\\\\r\\\\nbusiness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs a rule,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe more bizarre a thing is the less\\\\r\\\\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\\\r\\\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\\\r\\\\ndifficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you going to do, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo smoke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg\\\\r\\\\nthat you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to me for fifty minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He curled himself up\\\\r\\\\nin his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\\\r\\\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\\\r\\\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\\\\r\\\\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\\\\r\\\\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\\\\r\\\\nmind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSarasate plays at the St. James\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hall this afternoon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\\\r\\\\nhours?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the city first, and\\\\r\\\\nwe can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\\\\r\\\\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\\\r\\\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\\\\r\\\\nalong!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\\\r\\\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\\\r\\\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel\\\\r\\\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\\\\r\\\\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and\\\\r\\\\na few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a\\\\r\\\\nsmoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown\\\\r\\\\nboard with \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJABEZ WILSON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in white letters, upon a corner\\\\r\\\\nhouse, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his\\\\r\\\\nbusiness. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one\\\\r\\\\nside, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\\\\r\\\\npuckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again\\\\r\\\\nto the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned\\\\r\\\\nto the pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement\\\\r\\\\nwith his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.\\\\r\\\\nIt was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,\\\\r\\\\nwho asked him to step in.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI only wished to ask you how you would go\\\\r\\\\nfrom here to the Strand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThird right, fourth left,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered the assistant, promptly, closing\\\\r\\\\nthe door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSmart fellow, that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Holmes, as we walked away. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is, in my\\\\r\\\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\\\r\\\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\\\r\\\\nbefore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvidently,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Wilson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant counts for a good deal in\\\\r\\\\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\\\\r\\\\nway merely in order that you might see him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe knees of his trousers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what did you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat I expected to see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you beat the pavement?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\\\r\\\\nspies in an enemy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\\\r\\\\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner\\\\r\\\\nfrom the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to\\\\r\\\\nit as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\\\r\\\\narteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.\\\\r\\\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing\\\\r\\\\nin a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black\\\\r\\\\nwith the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize\\\\r\\\\nas we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises\\\\r\\\\nthat they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\\\\r\\\\nsquare which we had just quitted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along\\\\r\\\\nthe line, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\\\r\\\\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\\\r\\\\nMortimer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\\\\r\\\\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\\\\r\\\\nMcFarlane\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\\\\r\\\\nother block. And now, doctor, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done our work, so it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time we had\\\\r\\\\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\\\r\\\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\\\r\\\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a\\\\r\\\\nvery capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\\\r\\\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\\\r\\\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\\\r\\\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\\\r\\\\nof Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\\\r\\\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\\\r\\\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and\\\\r\\\\nhis extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\\\r\\\\nthought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\\\r\\\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\\\r\\\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\\\\r\\\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\\\r\\\\nhis arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\\\r\\\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\\\r\\\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\\\r\\\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\\\r\\\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\\\r\\\\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.\\\\r\\\\nJames\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\\\r\\\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to go home, no doubt, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, as we emerged.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it would be as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\\\r\\\\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy serious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\\\r\\\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\\\\r\\\\nrather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt what time?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTen will be early enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well. And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\\\r\\\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He waved his hand,\\\\r\\\\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always\\\\r\\\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\\\r\\\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\\\\r\\\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\\\r\\\\nonly what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the\\\\r\\\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to\\\\r\\\\nmy house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary\\\\r\\\\nstory of the red-headed copier of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEncyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d down to the visit\\\\r\\\\nto Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted\\\\r\\\\nfrom me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\\\r\\\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\\\\r\\\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant was a formidable man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\r\\\\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\\\r\\\\nup in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\\\r\\\\nexplanation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way\\\\r\\\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\\\r\\\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I\\\\r\\\\nheard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found\\\\r\\\\nHolmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized\\\\r\\\\nas Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long,\\\\r\\\\nthin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\\\r\\\\nfrock-coat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! our party is complete,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket,\\\\r\\\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWatson, I think\\\\r\\\\nyou know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\\\r\\\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s adventure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jones, in his\\\\r\\\\nconsequential way. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\\\r\\\\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\r\\\\npolice agent, loftily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he\\\\r\\\\nwon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\\\r\\\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to\\\\r\\\\nsay that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and\\\\r\\\\nthe Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\\\\r\\\\nforce.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the stranger,\\\\r\\\\nwith deference. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\\\r\\\\nfirst Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\\\\r\\\\nrubber.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think you will find,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you will play for\\\\r\\\\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\\\r\\\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\\\\r\\\\nsome \\\\xc2\\\\xa330,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish\\\\r\\\\nto lay your hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a young man,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\\\r\\\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a\\\\r\\\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\\\\r\\\\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\\\\r\\\\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\\\r\\\\nknow where to find the man himself. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\\\r\\\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\r\\\\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\\\\r\\\\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\\\\r\\\\nand quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\\\\r\\\\nWatson and I will follow in the second.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,\\\\r\\\\nand lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\\\r\\\\nafternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\\\r\\\\nuntil we emerged into Farringdon Street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe are close there now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d my friend remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis fellow Merryweather\\\\r\\\\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\\\\r\\\\nit as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\\\r\\\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\\\\r\\\\nis as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\\\\r\\\\nclaws upon any one. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\\\r\\\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following\\\\r\\\\nthe guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage\\\\r\\\\nand through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a\\\\r\\\\nsmall corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\\\r\\\\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\\\\r\\\\nat another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\\\\r\\\\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\\\\r\\\\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\\\\r\\\\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes remarked, as he held\\\\r\\\\nup the lantern and gazed about him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNor from below,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\\\r\\\\nflags which lined the floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nseverely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our\\\\r\\\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\\\r\\\\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\\\r\\\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees\\\\r\\\\nupon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to\\\\r\\\\nexamine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed\\\\r\\\\nto satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in\\\\r\\\\nhis pocket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have at least an hour before us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor they can\\\\r\\\\nhardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\\\r\\\\nThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work\\\\r\\\\nthe longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,\\\\r\\\\ndoctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94as no doubt you have divined\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in the cellar of the city branch\\\\r\\\\nof one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman\\\\r\\\\nof directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the\\\\r\\\\nmore daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in\\\\r\\\\nthis cellar at present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is our French gold,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered the director. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have had several\\\\r\\\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour French gold?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and\\\\r\\\\nborrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.\\\\r\\\\nIt has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the\\\\r\\\\nmoney, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which\\\\r\\\\nI sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\\\\r\\\\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\\\\r\\\\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\\\\r\\\\nsubject.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich were very well justified,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now it is time\\\\r\\\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\\\\r\\\\nwill come to a head. In the mean time, Mr. Merryweather, we must put\\\\r\\\\nthe screen over that dark lantern.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd sit in the dark?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\\\r\\\\nthought that, as we were a _partie carr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e_, you might have your rubber\\\\r\\\\nafter all. But I see that the enemy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s preparations have gone so far\\\\r\\\\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\\\\r\\\\nchoose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\\\\r\\\\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\\\r\\\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\\\\r\\\\nthose. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\\\\r\\\\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\\\r\\\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his\\\\r\\\\nlantern, and left us in pitch darkness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94such an absolute darkness\\\\r\\\\nas I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained\\\\r\\\\nto assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at\\\\r\\\\na moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of\\\\r\\\\nexpectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden\\\\r\\\\ngloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have but one retreat,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is back through\\\\r\\\\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\\\r\\\\nasked you, Jones?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\\\r\\\\nwait.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\\\r\\\\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\\\r\\\\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\\\\r\\\\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked\\\\r\\\\nup to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\\\\r\\\\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\\\\r\\\\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\\\\r\\\\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\\\\r\\\\nover the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\\\\r\\\\nthe glint of a light.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\\\r\\\\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\\\r\\\\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white,\\\\r\\\\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\\\\r\\\\nof light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\\\\r\\\\nprotruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\\\\r\\\\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\\\\r\\\\nmarked a chink between the stones.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\\\r\\\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and\\\\r\\\\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\\\\r\\\\nlantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\\\\r\\\\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\\\\r\\\\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\\\\r\\\\nrested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\\\\r\\\\nhole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\\\r\\\\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all clear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you the chisel and the bags.\\\\r\\\\nGreat Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll swing for it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\\\r\\\\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\\\r\\\\nas Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\\\\r\\\\nrevolver, but Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hunting crop came down on the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wrist, and\\\\r\\\\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no use, John Clay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, blandly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have no chance at\\\\r\\\\nall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the other answered, with the utmost coolness. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy that\\\\r\\\\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\\\r\\\\ncompliment you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour red-headed idea was very new and\\\\r\\\\neffective.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see your pal again presently,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jones. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quicker at\\\\r\\\\nclimbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked\\\\r\\\\nour prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may not\\\\r\\\\nbe aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\\\\r\\\\nwhen you address me always to say \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98sir\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, would you\\\\r\\\\nplease, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\\\r\\\\nhighness to the police-station?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is better,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Clay, serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\\\r\\\\nthe three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from\\\\r\\\\nthe cellar, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\\\r\\\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\\\r\\\\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\\\r\\\\nthat have ever come within my experience.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\\\r\\\\nJohn Clay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been at some small expense over this\\\\r\\\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\\\r\\\\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\\\\r\\\\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained, in the early hours of the morning,\\\\r\\\\nas we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit was\\\\r\\\\nperfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this\\\\r\\\\nrather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the\\\\r\\\\ncopying of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 must be to get this not over-bright\\\\r\\\\npawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a\\\\r\\\\ncurious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to\\\\r\\\\nsuggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ingenious\\\\r\\\\nmind by the color of his accomplice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hair. The \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a week was a lure\\\\r\\\\nwhich must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for\\\\r\\\\nthousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary\\\\r\\\\noffice, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together\\\\r\\\\nthey manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From\\\\r\\\\nthe time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages,\\\\r\\\\nit was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the\\\\r\\\\nsituation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\\\r\\\\nvulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\\\r\\\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\\\\r\\\\nas they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\\\\r\\\\ncould it be? I thought of the assistant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fondness for photography,\\\\r\\\\nand his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the\\\\r\\\\nend of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\\\r\\\\nassistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest\\\\r\\\\nand most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\\\\r\\\\ncellar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\\\r\\\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\\\\r\\\\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\\\r\\\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\\\r\\\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\\\\r\\\\nIt was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\\\\r\\\\nassistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never\\\\r\\\\nset eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His\\\\r\\\\nknees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how\\\\r\\\\nworn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\\\r\\\\nburrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\\\\r\\\\nwalked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on\\\\r\\\\nour friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\\\\r\\\\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the\\\\r\\\\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\r\\\\nasked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\\\r\\\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s presence\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in other words,\\\\r\\\\nthat they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they\\\\r\\\\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might\\\\r\\\\nbe removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\\\\r\\\\nwould give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\\\\r\\\\nexpected them to come to-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I exclaimed, in unfeigned\\\\r\\\\nadmiration. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt saved me from ennui,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered, yawning. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas! I already feel\\\\r\\\\nit closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\\\r\\\\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\\\r\\\\nso.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\\\r\\\\nlittle use,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98L\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99homme c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99est rien\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94l\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99oeuvre c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99est\\\\r\\\\ntout,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure III\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA CASE OF IDENTITY\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side\\\\r\\\\nof the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clife is infinitely\\\\r\\\\nstranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would\\\\r\\\\nnot dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of\\\\r\\\\nexistence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over\\\\r\\\\nthis great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer\\\\r\\\\nthings which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,\\\\r\\\\nthe cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\\\r\\\\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_ results, it would make all\\\\r\\\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\\\\r\\\\nand unprofitable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe cases which come\\\\r\\\\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\\\r\\\\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,\\\\r\\\\nand yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\\\r\\\\nartistic.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\\\r\\\\nrealistic effect,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is wanting in the police\\\\r\\\\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\\\\r\\\\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\\\\r\\\\nvital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it there is nothing so\\\\r\\\\nunnatural as the commonplace.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI smiled and shook my head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can quite understand you thinking so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nI said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\\\\r\\\\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\\\\r\\\\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\\\r\\\\nhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I picked up the morning paper from the ground\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clet us put it\\\\r\\\\nto a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A\\\\r\\\\nhusband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cruelty to his wife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There is half a column of print, but\\\\r\\\\nI know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.\\\\r\\\\nThere is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow,\\\\r\\\\nthe bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\\\\r\\\\ncould invent nothing more crude.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis\\\\r\\\\nis the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in\\\\r\\\\nclearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was\\\\r\\\\na teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of\\\\r\\\\nwas that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by\\\\r\\\\ntaking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you\\\\r\\\\nwill allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\\\\r\\\\naverage story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge\\\\r\\\\nthat I have scored over you in your example.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\\\r\\\\ncentre of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways\\\\r\\\\nand simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is\\\\r\\\\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\\\\r\\\\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the ring?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\\\r\\\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\\\\r\\\\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\\\\r\\\\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\\\\r\\\\nproblems.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd have you any on hand just now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, with interest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\\\r\\\\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\\\\r\\\\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is\\\\r\\\\na field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\\\\r\\\\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\\\\r\\\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as\\\\r\\\\na rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\\\r\\\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\\\r\\\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\\\\r\\\\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\\\\r\\\\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted\\\\r\\\\nblinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street.\\\\r\\\\nLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there\\\\r\\\\nstood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large\\\\r\\\\ncurling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a\\\\r\\\\ncoquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under\\\\r\\\\nthis great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\\\\r\\\\nour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her\\\\r\\\\nfingers fidgetted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as\\\\r\\\\nof the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we\\\\r\\\\nheard the sharp clang of the bell.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen those symptoms before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, throwing his\\\\r\\\\ncigarette into the fire. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOscillation upon the pavement always means an\\\\r\\\\n_affaire de c\\\\xc5\\\\x93ur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\\\r\\\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\\\\r\\\\ndiscriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\\\r\\\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\\\\r\\\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\\\r\\\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\\\\r\\\\nresolve our doubts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\\\r\\\\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\\\r\\\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\\\r\\\\npilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\\\r\\\\nwhich he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into\\\\r\\\\nan arm-chair, he looked her over in the minute, and yet abstracted\\\\r\\\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not find,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat with your short sight it is a little\\\\r\\\\ntrying to do so much type-writing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did at first,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she answered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut now I know where the letters\\\\r\\\\nare without looking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of\\\\r\\\\nhis words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\\\r\\\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard about me,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9celse how could you know all that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is my business to know things.\\\\r\\\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\\\r\\\\nshould you come to consult me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\\\r\\\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and every one had given him\\\\r\\\\nup for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\r\\\\nnot rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides\\\\r\\\\nthe little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know\\\\r\\\\nwhat has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Sherlock\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\\\r\\\\nSutherland. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I did bang out of the house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor it\\\\r\\\\nmade me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is, my\\\\r\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not\\\\r\\\\ngo to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying\\\\r\\\\nthat there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my\\\\r\\\\nthings and came right away to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour father,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyour step-father, surely, since the name\\\\r\\\\nis different.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, my step-father. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\\\r\\\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd your mother is alive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nwhen she married again so soon after father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death, and a man who was\\\\r\\\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\\\r\\\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\\\r\\\\nmother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\\\\r\\\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\\\r\\\\ntraveller in wines. They got \\\\xc2\\\\xa34700 for the goodwill and interest, which\\\\r\\\\nwasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\\\r\\\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\\\r\\\\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour own little income,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdoes it come out of the business?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle Ned\\\\r\\\\nin Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4-1/2 per cent. Two\\\\r\\\\nthousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the\\\\r\\\\ninterest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou interest me extremely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd since you draw so large\\\\r\\\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\\\r\\\\ndoubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way. I believe\\\\r\\\\nthat a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \\\\xc2\\\\xa360.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\\\\r\\\\nthat as long as I live at home I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wish to be a burden to them, and\\\\r\\\\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\\\\r\\\\ncourse, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\\\\r\\\\nevery quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\\\\r\\\\npretty well with what I earn at type-writing. It brings me twopence a\\\\r\\\\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have made your position very clear to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is\\\\r\\\\nmy friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\\\r\\\\nmyself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\\\r\\\\nAngel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, and she picked nervously at\\\\r\\\\nthe fringe of her jacket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI met him first at the gasfitters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ball,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nshe said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\\\r\\\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank\\\\r\\\\ndid not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\\\r\\\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.\\\\r\\\\nBut this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had\\\\r\\\\nhe to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\\\r\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit\\\\r\\\\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\\\\r\\\\nout of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off\\\\r\\\\nto France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I,\\\\r\\\\nwith Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from\\\\r\\\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\\\r\\\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\\\r\\\\nwoman, for she would have her way.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see. Then at the gasfitters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ball you met, as I understand, a\\\\r\\\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\\\r\\\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is to say, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\\\r\\\\nagain, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you know, father didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\r\\\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\\\r\\\\nshould be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\\\r\\\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\\\\r\\\\nmine yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\\\r\\\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\\\r\\\\nhe had gone. We could write in the mean time, and he used to write\\\\r\\\\nevery day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need\\\\r\\\\nfor father to know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\\\\r\\\\ntook. Hosmer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Mr. Angel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\\\r\\\\nStreet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat office?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere did he live, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe slept on the premises.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know his address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94except that it was Leadenhall Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere did you address your letters, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo the Leadenhall Street Post-office, to be left till called for. He\\\\r\\\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\\\r\\\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\\\r\\\\ntype-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have that, for he\\\\r\\\\nsaid that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they\\\\r\\\\nwere type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us.\\\\r\\\\nThat will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the\\\\r\\\\nlittle things that he would think of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was most suggestive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt has long been an axiom of\\\\r\\\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\\\r\\\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in\\\\r\\\\nthe evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\\\r\\\\nconspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\\\r\\\\ngentle. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\\\r\\\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\\\r\\\\nwhispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\\\\r\\\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\\\r\\\\nglasses against the glare.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your step-father, returned\\\\r\\\\nto France?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should\\\\r\\\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest, and made\\\\r\\\\nme swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I\\\\r\\\\nwould always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me\\\\r\\\\nswear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his\\\\r\\\\nfavor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when\\\\r\\\\nthey talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father;\\\\r\\\\nbut they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\\\r\\\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\\\r\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\\\\r\\\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want\\\\r\\\\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\\\r\\\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\\\r\\\\nvery morning of the wedding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt missed him, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\\\r\\\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, near King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\\\r\\\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he\\\\r\\\\nput us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\\\r\\\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\\\\r\\\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\\\r\\\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\\\r\\\\nlooked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\\\r\\\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\\\r\\\\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\\\\r\\\\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nHolmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\\\r\\\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\\\\r\\\\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate\\\\r\\\\nus, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he\\\\r\\\\nwould claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\\\\r\\\\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\\\r\\\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\\\r\\\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\\\r\\\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could any\\\\r\\\\none have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\\\\r\\\\nme? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\\\r\\\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was\\\\r\\\\nvery independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of\\\\r\\\\nmine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\\\\r\\\\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep a wink at\\\\r\\\\nnight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to\\\\r\\\\nsob heavily into it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall glance into the case for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, rising; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I\\\\r\\\\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight\\\\r\\\\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon\\\\r\\\\nit further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\\\\r\\\\nmemory, as he has done from your life.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see him again?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fear not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen what has happened to him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\\\r\\\\ndescription of him, and any letters of his which you can spare.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI advertised for him in last Saturday\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s _Chronicle_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere\\\\r\\\\nis the slip, and here are four letters from him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. And your address?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Angel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\\\r\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place of business?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\\\r\\\\nFenchurch Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave\\\\r\\\\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let\\\\r\\\\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\\\\r\\\\nlife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true\\\\r\\\\nto Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\\\r\\\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\\\r\\\\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way,\\\\r\\\\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger-tips still\\\\r\\\\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\\\\r\\\\ndirected upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the\\\\r\\\\nold and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having\\\\r\\\\nlit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\\\\r\\\\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he observed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI found her\\\\r\\\\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\\\\r\\\\na trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\\\r\\\\nAndover in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\\\r\\\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\\\\r\\\\nwere new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\\\r\\\\nme,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\\\\r\\\\nand so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\\\\r\\\\nrealize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\\\r\\\\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\\\\r\\\\ngather from that woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s appearance? Describe it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather\\\\r\\\\nof a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it,\\\\r\\\\nand a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather\\\\r\\\\ndarker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and\\\\r\\\\nsleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right\\\\r\\\\nforefinger. Her boots I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t observe. She had small, round, hanging\\\\r\\\\ngold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a\\\\r\\\\nvulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\\\r\\\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\\\r\\\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\\\r\\\\nhave a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my boy,\\\\r\\\\nbut concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a\\\\r\\\\nwoman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee\\\\r\\\\nof the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves,\\\\r\\\\nwhich is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line\\\\r\\\\na little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the\\\\r\\\\ntable, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,\\\\r\\\\nleaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it\\\\r\\\\nfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest\\\\r\\\\npart, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint\\\\r\\\\nof a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon\\\\r\\\\nshort sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt surprised me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised and\\\\r\\\\ninterested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she\\\\r\\\\nwas wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the\\\\r\\\\none having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.\\\\r\\\\nOne was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the\\\\r\\\\nother at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young\\\\r\\\\nlady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\\\\r\\\\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\\\\r\\\\nhurry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what else?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\\\r\\\\nfriend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s incisive reasoning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home,\\\\r\\\\nbut after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\\\\r\\\\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\\\\r\\\\nand finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry,\\\\r\\\\nand dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the\\\\r\\\\nmark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing,\\\\r\\\\nthough rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would\\\\r\\\\nyou mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMissing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9con\\\\r\\\\nthe morning of the 14th, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft. 7\\\\r\\\\nin. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little\\\\r\\\\nbald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted\\\\r\\\\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in\\\\r\\\\nblack frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,\\\\r\\\\nand gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided\\\\r\\\\nboots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.\\\\r\\\\nAnybody bringing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d etc., etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs to the letters,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued,\\\\r\\\\nglancing over them, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clew\\\\r\\\\nin them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\\\r\\\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are type-written,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot only that, but the signature is type-written. Look at the neat\\\\r\\\\nlittle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hosmer Angel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\\\r\\\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\\\\r\\\\npoint about the signature is very suggestive\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in fact, we may call it\\\\r\\\\nconclusive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\\\r\\\\nupon the case?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to\\\\r\\\\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\\\r\\\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the city, the other is\\\\r\\\\nto the young lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s step-father, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he\\\\r\\\\ncould meet us here at six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well\\\\r\\\\nthat we should do business with the male relatives. And now, doctor, we\\\\r\\\\ncan do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put\\\\r\\\\nour little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s subtle powers of\\\\r\\\\nreasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must\\\\r\\\\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he\\\\r\\\\ntreated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.\\\\r\\\\nOnce only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia\\\\r\\\\nand of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird\\\\r\\\\nbusiness of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances\\\\r\\\\nconnected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange\\\\r\\\\ntangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\\\r\\\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\\\\r\\\\nhe held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity\\\\r\\\\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\\\r\\\\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\\\\r\\\\nsufferer. It was not until close upon six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock that I found myself\\\\r\\\\nfree, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\\\\r\\\\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _d\\\\xc3\\\\xa9nouement_\\\\r\\\\nof the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\\\\r\\\\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\\\r\\\\narm-chair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\\\r\\\\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\\\r\\\\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, have you solved it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, as I entered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, the mystery!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\\\\r\\\\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\\\\r\\\\nof the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\\\\r\\\\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\\\r\\\\nSutherland?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\\\r\\\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a\\\\r\\\\ntap at the door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s step-father, Mr. James Windibank,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\r\\\\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\\\r\\\\nyears of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland,\\\\r\\\\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\\\r\\\\ngray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\\\\r\\\\ntop hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\\\\r\\\\nnearest chair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that this\\\\r\\\\ntype-written letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\\\r\\\\nme for six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\\\\r\\\\nown master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\\\\r\\\\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\\\\r\\\\nlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\\\\r\\\\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\\\\r\\\\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her\\\\r\\\\nmind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\\\\r\\\\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\\\\r\\\\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\\\\r\\\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have every reason to\\\\r\\\\nbelieve that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am\\\\r\\\\ndelighted to hear it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a curious thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat a type-writer has\\\\r\\\\nreally quite as much individuality as a man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s handwriting. Unless they\\\\r\\\\nare quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get\\\\r\\\\nmore worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark\\\\r\\\\nin this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\\\\r\\\\nlittle slurring over of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98e,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and a slight defect in the tail of the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98r.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\\\r\\\\nobvious.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\\\r\\\\ndoubt it is a little worn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\\\r\\\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Windibank,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes continued. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think of writing another little\\\\r\\\\nmonograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to\\\\r\\\\ncrime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.\\\\r\\\\nI have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.\\\\r\\\\nThey are all type-written. In each case, not only are the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98e\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 slurred\\\\r\\\\nand the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98r\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\\\r\\\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\\\\r\\\\nhave alluded are there as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot\\\\r\\\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf\\\\r\\\\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\\\r\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\\\r\\\\ndoor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! where?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips, and\\\\r\\\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94really it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, suavely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is no\\\\r\\\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\\\\r\\\\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\\\\r\\\\nfor me to solve so simple a question. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right! Sit down, and let\\\\r\\\\nus talk it over.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter\\\\r\\\\nof moisture on his brow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not actionable,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he stammered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\\\r\\\\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\\\\r\\\\nway as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of\\\\r\\\\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\\\r\\\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\\\\r\\\\nthe corner of the mantel-piece, and, leaning back with his hands in his\\\\r\\\\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\\\r\\\\nas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their\\\\r\\\\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.\\\\r\\\\nIt was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good,\\\\r\\\\namiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so\\\\r\\\\nthat it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her\\\\r\\\\nlittle income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\\\\r\\\\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\\\\r\\\\ndoes her step-father do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\\\\r\\\\nkeeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people\\\\r\\\\nof her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever.\\\\r\\\\nShe became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\\\\r\\\\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\\\r\\\\nstep-father do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\\\r\\\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\\\\r\\\\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\\\\r\\\\nthe face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\\\\r\\\\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\\\r\\\\ngirl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\\\\r\\\\nlovers by making love himself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was only a joke at first,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d groaned our visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe never thought\\\\r\\\\nthat she would have been so carried away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\\\r\\\\ndecidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her\\\\r\\\\nstep-father was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for\\\\r\\\\nan instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\\\r\\\\nadmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\\\\r\\\\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go,\\\\r\\\\nif a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\\\r\\\\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s affections from\\\\r\\\\nturning towards any one else. But the deception could not be kept up\\\\r\\\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\\\r\\\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\\\r\\\\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\\\r\\\\nyoung lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\\\r\\\\nfor some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\\\r\\\\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\\\r\\\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\\\r\\\\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\\\\r\\\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\\\\r\\\\nto another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\\\\r\\\\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\\\\r\\\\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other. I\\\\r\\\\nthink that that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\\\\r\\\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\\\\r\\\\npale face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut if you are so\\\\r\\\\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\\\\r\\\\nbreaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\\\\r\\\\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\\\\r\\\\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, unlocking and\\\\r\\\\nthrowing open the door, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyet there never was a man who deserved\\\\r\\\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\\\\r\\\\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, flushing\\\\r\\\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is not\\\\r\\\\npart of my duties to my client, but here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a hunting crop handy, and I\\\\r\\\\nthink I shall just treat myself to\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took two swift steps to the\\\\r\\\\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\\\\r\\\\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\\\\r\\\\ncould see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\\\r\\\\nroad.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\\\r\\\\nhimself down into his chair once more. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat fellow will rise from\\\\r\\\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\\\r\\\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\\\\r\\\\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\\\\r\\\\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident,\\\\r\\\\nas far as we could see, was the step-father. Then the fact that the\\\\r\\\\ntwo men were never together, but that the one always appeared when\\\\r\\\\nthe other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and\\\\r\\\\nthe curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy\\\\r\\\\nwhiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action\\\\r\\\\nin type-writing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\\\\r\\\\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the\\\\r\\\\nsmallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with\\\\r\\\\nmany minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how did you verify them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I\\\\r\\\\nknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\\\r\\\\ndescription, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\\\r\\\\nof a disguise\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it\\\\r\\\\nto the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it\\\\r\\\\nanswered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already\\\\r\\\\nnoticed the peculiarities of the type-writer, and I wrote to the man\\\\r\\\\nhimself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. As\\\\r\\\\nI expected, his reply was type-written, and revealed the same trivial\\\\r\\\\nbut characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\\\r\\\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\\\r\\\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employ\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, James Windibank.\\\\r\\\\n_Voila tout!_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd Miss Sutherland?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\\\\r\\\\nPersian saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\\\\r\\\\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There is as\\\\r\\\\nmuch sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure IV\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\\\r\\\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes, and ran in this way:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from\\\\r\\\\nthe West of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall\\\\r\\\\nbe glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave\\\\r\\\\nPaddington by the 11.15.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you say, dear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my wife, looking across at me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you\\\\r\\\\ngo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\\\r\\\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you\\\\r\\\\nare always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cases.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\\\r\\\\nof them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I\\\\r\\\\nhave only half an hour.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect\\\\r\\\\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and\\\\r\\\\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my\\\\r\\\\nvalise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing\\\\r\\\\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\\\\r\\\\ntaller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt makes a\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable difference to me, having some one with me on whom I can\\\\r\\\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\\\r\\\\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\\\\r\\\\nwhich Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,\\\\r\\\\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\\\\r\\\\nReading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and\\\\r\\\\ntossed them up onto the rack.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you heard anything of the case?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just\\\\r\\\\nbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\\\r\\\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple\\\\r\\\\ncases which are so extremely difficult.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clew.\\\\r\\\\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is\\\\r\\\\nit to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a\\\\r\\\\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a murder, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted\\\\r\\\\nuntil I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will\\\\r\\\\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to\\\\r\\\\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\\\r\\\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\\\r\\\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia, and returned some years ago to\\\\r\\\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\\\\r\\\\nlet to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had\\\\r\\\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\\\r\\\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\\\r\\\\npossible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\\\r\\\\ntenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality,\\\\r\\\\nas they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of\\\\r\\\\neighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither\\\\r\\\\nof them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of\\\\r\\\\nthe neighboring English families, and to have led retired lives, though\\\\r\\\\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at\\\\r\\\\nthe race-meetings of the neighborhood. McCarthy kept two servants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\r\\\\nman and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen\\\\r\\\\nat the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\\\r\\\\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn June 3, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\\\r\\\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe\\\\r\\\\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the\\\\r\\\\nstream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his\\\\r\\\\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\\\\r\\\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\\\r\\\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\\\r\\\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\\\r\\\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\\\r\\\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\\\r\\\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within\\\\r\\\\na few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\\\\r\\\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\\\r\\\\nthe son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he\\\\r\\\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\\\r\\\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly-wooded\\\\r\\\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl\\\\r\\\\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\\\r\\\\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\\\r\\\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\\\r\\\\nand close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\\\r\\\\nto be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\\\\r\\\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up\\\\r\\\\nhis hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\\\\r\\\\nviolence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home\\\\r\\\\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\\\\r\\\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\\\\r\\\\nthe words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\\\r\\\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\\\r\\\\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\\\\r\\\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\\\r\\\\nfresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\\\\r\\\\nupon the grass beside the Pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\\\\r\\\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\\\\r\\\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gun, which\\\\r\\\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\\\\r\\\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\\\r\\\\nof \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Wilful Murder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,\\\\r\\\\nhe was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\\\r\\\\nreferred the case to the next assizes. Those are the main facts of the\\\\r\\\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf ever\\\\r\\\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nthoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\\\r\\\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing\\\\r\\\\nin an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.\\\\r\\\\nIt must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\\\r\\\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\\\r\\\\nculprit. There are several people in the neighborhood, however, and\\\\r\\\\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighboring land-owner,\\\\r\\\\nwho believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you\\\\r\\\\nmay recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the\\\\r\\\\ncase in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\\\\r\\\\ncase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\\\r\\\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their\\\\r\\\\nbreakfasts at home.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat the facts are so obvious that you will\\\\r\\\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered,\\\\r\\\\nlaughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\\\r\\\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\\\r\\\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\\\\r\\\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\\\r\\\\nemploying, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\\\\r\\\\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\\\r\\\\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\\\\r\\\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\\\r\\\\ncharacterizes you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\\\\r\\\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\\\r\\\\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\\\\r\\\\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\\\\r\\\\nthat that side is less well illuminated than the other. I could not\\\\r\\\\nimagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and\\\\r\\\\nbeing satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial\\\\r\\\\nexample of observation and inference. Therein lies my _m\\\\xc3\\\\xa9tier_, and it\\\\r\\\\nis just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation\\\\r\\\\nwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were\\\\r\\\\nbrought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHEY FOUND THE BODY\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\\\r\\\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing\\\\r\\\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\\\r\\\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\\\\r\\\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\\\r\\\\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jury.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a confession,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\\\r\\\\na most suspicious remark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is the brightest rift which I can\\\\r\\\\nat present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\\\\r\\\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\\\r\\\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\\\\r\\\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\\\\r\\\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\\\r\\\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy\\\\r\\\\nto a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\\\r\\\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\\\r\\\\nand firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\\\r\\\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\\\r\\\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\\\r\\\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\\\r\\\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\\\r\\\\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\\\\r\\\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\\\r\\\\nmind, rather than of a guilty one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI shook my head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nI remarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the young man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own account of the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\\\r\\\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find\\\\r\\\\nit here, and may read it for yourself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\\\\r\\\\nand having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which\\\\r\\\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\\\r\\\\noccurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read\\\\r\\\\nit very carefully. It ran in this way:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and\\\\r\\\\ngave evidence as follows: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I had been away from home for three days at\\\\r\\\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\\\\r\\\\nthe 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\\\r\\\\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\\\\r\\\\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\\\\r\\\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\\\\r\\\\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\\\\r\\\\nwas going. I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of\\\\r\\\\nthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren\\\\r\\\\nwhich is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\\\r\\\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\\\r\\\\nthinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\\\\r\\\\nfront of me. When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\\\\r\\\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool. He appeared to be\\\\r\\\\nmuch surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was\\\\r\\\\ndoing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost\\\\r\\\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing\\\\r\\\\nthat his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned\\\\r\\\\ntowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,\\\\r\\\\nwhen I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back\\\\r\\\\nagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head\\\\r\\\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he\\\\r\\\\nalmost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then\\\\r\\\\nmade my way to Mr. Turner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest,\\\\r\\\\nto ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and\\\\r\\\\nI have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\\\\r\\\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far\\\\r\\\\nas I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion\\\\r\\\\nto a rat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had\\\\r\\\\nthis final quarrel?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\\\r\\\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\\\r\\\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\\\\r\\\\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: I must still refuse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 was a common signal\\\\r\\\\nbetween you and your father?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: It was.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\\\\r\\\\nand before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\\\r\\\\nreturned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: Nothing definite.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\\\r\\\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\\\r\\\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\\\\r\\\\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of\\\\r\\\\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked\\\\r\\\\nround for it, but it was gone.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, it was gone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You cannot say what it was?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I had a feeling something was there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98How far from the body?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A dozen yards or so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And how far from the edge of the wood?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98About the same.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\\\\r\\\\nit?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, but with my back towards it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, as I glanced down the column, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat the coroner in\\\\r\\\\nhis concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls\\\\r\\\\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\\\r\\\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\\\\r\\\\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\\\\r\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against\\\\r\\\\nthe son.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the\\\\r\\\\ncushioned seat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nfavor. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\\\\r\\\\ntoo much imagination and too little. Too little, if he could not invent\\\\r\\\\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury;\\\\r\\\\ntoo much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything\\\\r\\\\nso _outr\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\\\\r\\\\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\\\\r\\\\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\\\r\\\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\\\\r\\\\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\\\\r\\\\naction. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\\\\r\\\\nminutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was nearly four o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock when we at last, after passing through\\\\r\\\\nthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\\\\r\\\\nfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,\\\\r\\\\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\\\\r\\\\nplatform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\\\\r\\\\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove\\\\r\\\\nto the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have ordered a carriage,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade, as we sat over a cup of\\\\r\\\\ntea. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy\\\\r\\\\nuntil you had been on the scene of the crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is\\\\r\\\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade looked startled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not quite follow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\\\r\\\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\\\\r\\\\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do\\\\r\\\\nnot think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have, no doubt, already formed your\\\\r\\\\nconclusions from the newspapers,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe case is as plain as a\\\\r\\\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\\\\r\\\\nof course, one can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\\\r\\\\nShe had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly\\\\r\\\\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not\\\\r\\\\nalready done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\\\r\\\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\\\r\\\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\\\\r\\\\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, glancing from one to the other\\\\r\\\\nof us, and finally, with a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quick intuition, fastening upon my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell\\\\r\\\\nyou so. I know that James didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\\\r\\\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\\\\r\\\\nthat point. We have known each other since we were little children, and\\\\r\\\\nI know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\\\\r\\\\nhurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to any one who really knows him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may\\\\r\\\\nrely upon my doing all that I can.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do\\\\r\\\\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he\\\\r\\\\nis innocent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that it is very probable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere, now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, throwing back her head, and looking defiantly\\\\r\\\\nat Lestrade. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that my colleague has\\\\r\\\\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\\\r\\\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\\\\r\\\\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\\\\r\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn what way?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\\\r\\\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\\\\r\\\\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as\\\\r\\\\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little\\\\r\\\\nof life yet, and\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\\\\r\\\\nlike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\\\r\\\\nthem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd your father?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas he in favor of such a union?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favor of\\\\r\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\\\\r\\\\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you for this information,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMay I see your father if I\\\\r\\\\ncall to-morrow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid the doctor won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t allow it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe doctor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\\\r\\\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\\\\r\\\\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is\\\\r\\\\nshattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\\\\r\\\\nold days in Victoria.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, at the mines.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made\\\\r\\\\nhis money.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, certainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go\\\\r\\\\nto the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that\\\\r\\\\nI know him to be innocent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will, Miss Turner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\\\\r\\\\nleave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She hurried\\\\r\\\\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\\\r\\\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade, with dignity, after a few\\\\r\\\\nminutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 silence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\\\r\\\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you an order to see him in prison?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but only for you and me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\\\\r\\\\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but\\\\r\\\\nI shall only be away a couple of hours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\\\\r\\\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I\\\\r\\\\nlay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed\\\\r\\\\nnovel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared\\\\r\\\\nto the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my\\\\r\\\\nattention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that I\\\\r\\\\nat last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a\\\\r\\\\nconsideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy\\\\r\\\\nyoung man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred\\\\r\\\\nbetween the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\\\\r\\\\ndrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something\\\\r\\\\nterrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\\\r\\\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell,\\\\r\\\\nand called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim\\\\r\\\\naccount of the inquest. In the surgeon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s deposition it was stated that\\\\r\\\\nthe posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the\\\\r\\\\noccipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.\\\\r\\\\nI marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been\\\\r\\\\nstruck from behind. That was to some extent in favor of the accused,\\\\r\\\\nas when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still,\\\\r\\\\nit did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\\\\r\\\\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\\\\r\\\\nHolmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference\\\\r\\\\nto a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying\\\\r\\\\nfrom a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more\\\\r\\\\nlikely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could\\\\r\\\\nit indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\\\r\\\\nAnd then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young McCarthy. If\\\\r\\\\nthat were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\\\r\\\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood\\\\r\\\\nto return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling\\\\r\\\\nwith his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries\\\\r\\\\nand improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s insight that\\\\r\\\\nI could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\\\\r\\\\nhis conviction of young McCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s innocence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\\\r\\\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe glass still keeps very high,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, as he sat down. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is\\\\r\\\\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\\\\r\\\\nground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\\\\r\\\\nfor such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\\\\r\\\\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what did you learn from him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould he throw no light?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\\\r\\\\ndone it, and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he\\\\r\\\\nis as puzzled as every one else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\\\\r\\\\nthough comely to look at, and, I should think, sound at heart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot admire his taste,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif it is indeed a fact that\\\\r\\\\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss\\\\r\\\\nTurner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\\\\r\\\\ninsanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\\\\r\\\\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\\\\r\\\\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\\\\r\\\\na barmaid in Bristol, and marry her at a registry office? No one knows\\\\r\\\\na word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to\\\\r\\\\nhim to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to\\\\r\\\\ndo, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy\\\\r\\\\nof this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\\\\r\\\\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\\\r\\\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\\\\r\\\\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\\\\r\\\\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife\\\\r\\\\nthat he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\\\\r\\\\nnot know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\\\\r\\\\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\\\\r\\\\nthat he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown\\\\r\\\\nhim over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband\\\\r\\\\nalready in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\\\\r\\\\nthem. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\\\r\\\\nthat he has suffered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\\\r\\\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the\\\\r\\\\nPool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son\\\\r\\\\nwas away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that\\\\r\\\\nthe murdered man was heard to cry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 before he knew that his son\\\\r\\\\nhad returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.\\\\r\\\\nAnd now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\\\\r\\\\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\\\\r\\\\nbright and cloudless. At nine o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock Lestrade called for us with the\\\\r\\\\ncarriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is serious news this morning,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Lestrade observed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is said\\\\r\\\\nthat Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn elderly man, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\\\\r\\\\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\\\\r\\\\nhas had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s,\\\\r\\\\nand, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\\\\r\\\\ngave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! That is interesting,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\\\\r\\\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\\\\r\\\\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\\\\r\\\\nunder such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his\\\\r\\\\nson to Turner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate,\\\\r\\\\nand that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of\\\\r\\\\na proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\\\\r\\\\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\\\\r\\\\nas much. Do you not deduce something from that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade,\\\\r\\\\nwinking at me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\\\r\\\\nflying away after theories and fancies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, demurely; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou do find it very hard to\\\\r\\\\ntackle the facts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\\\r\\\\nget hold of,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied Lestrade, with some warmth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that is\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that\\\\r\\\\nall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\\\\r\\\\nleft.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, that is it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building,\\\\r\\\\ntwo-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\\\r\\\\nthe gray walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\\\r\\\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still\\\\r\\\\nlay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\\\\r\\\\ndeath, and also a pair of the son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, though not the pair which he had\\\\r\\\\nthen had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\\\\r\\\\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\\\\r\\\\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTHE MAID SHOWED US THE BOOTS.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\\\\r\\\\nas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\\\\r\\\\nBaker Street would have failed to recognize him. His face flushed and\\\\r\\\\ndarkened. His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his\\\\r\\\\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\\\\r\\\\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\\\\r\\\\nstood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\\\\r\\\\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question\\\\r\\\\nor remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked\\\\r\\\\na quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his\\\\r\\\\nway along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\\\\r\\\\nthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all\\\\r\\\\nthat district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path\\\\r\\\\nand amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes\\\\r\\\\nHolmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a\\\\r\\\\nlittle _d\\\\xc3\\\\xa9tour_ into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the\\\\r\\\\ndetective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with\\\\r\\\\nthe interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his\\\\r\\\\nactions was directed towards a definite end.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\\\\r\\\\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\\\\r\\\\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\\\\r\\\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\\\\r\\\\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dwelling. On\\\\r\\\\nthe Hatherley side of the Pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\\\r\\\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\\\\r\\\\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\\\\r\\\\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\\\\r\\\\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\\\\r\\\\nthe fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\\\\r\\\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\\\\r\\\\ntrampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\\\\r\\\\nthen turned upon my companion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you go into the Pool for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\\\\r\\\\nother trace. But how on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\\\r\\\\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\\\\r\\\\nvanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\\\\r\\\\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all\\\\r\\\\nover it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they\\\\r\\\\nhave covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But\\\\r\\\\nhere are three separate tracks of the same feet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He drew out a lens,\\\\r\\\\nand lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all\\\\r\\\\nthe time rather to himself than to us. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese are young McCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nfeet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles\\\\r\\\\nare deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\\\r\\\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\\\r\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\\\\r\\\\nbutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What\\\\r\\\\nhave we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They\\\\r\\\\ncome, they go, they come again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94of course that was for the cloak.\\\\r\\\\nNow where did they come from?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ran up and down, sometimes losing,\\\\r\\\\nsometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the\\\\r\\\\nwood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the\\\\r\\\\nneighborhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and\\\\r\\\\nlay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.\\\\r\\\\nFor a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried\\\\r\\\\nsticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and\\\\r\\\\nexamining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the\\\\r\\\\ntree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss,\\\\r\\\\nand this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a\\\\r\\\\npathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all\\\\r\\\\ntraces were lost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, returning\\\\r\\\\nto his natural manner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fancy that this gray house on the right must\\\\r\\\\nbe the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\\\\r\\\\nperhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\\\\r\\\\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back\\\\r\\\\ninto Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked\\\\r\\\\nup in the wood.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, holding it out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe\\\\r\\\\nmurder was done with it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see no marks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\\\\r\\\\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\\\\r\\\\nwith the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the murderer?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\\\r\\\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\\\\r\\\\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket. There are\\\\r\\\\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\\\\r\\\\nsearch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\\\r\\\\nBritish jury.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c_Nous verrons_,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered Holmes, calmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou work your own method,\\\\r\\\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\\\r\\\\nprobably return to London by the evening train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd leave your case unfinished?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, finished.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the mystery?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is solved.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho was the criminal, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe gentleman I describe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut who is he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\\\r\\\\npopulous neighborhood.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am a practical man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\\\\r\\\\nfor a left-handed gentleman with a game-leg. I should become the\\\\r\\\\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have given you the chance. Here\\\\r\\\\nare your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\\\\r\\\\nfound lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought\\\\r\\\\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\\\\r\\\\nperplexing position.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook here, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, when the cloth was cleared; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cjust sit\\\\r\\\\ndown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite\\\\r\\\\nknow what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar, and let\\\\r\\\\nme expound.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\\\r\\\\nMcCarthy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\\\r\\\\nimpressed me in his favor and you against him. One was the fact that\\\\r\\\\nhis father should, according to his account, cry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 before seeing\\\\r\\\\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled\\\\r\\\\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\near. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\\\\r\\\\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat of this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\\\\r\\\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within\\\\r\\\\near-shot. The \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 was meant to attract the attention of whoever\\\\r\\\\nit was that he had the appointment with. But \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Cooee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 is a distinctly\\\\r\\\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a\\\\r\\\\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\\\\r\\\\nat Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in Australia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat of the rat, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\\\\r\\\\nout on the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put his hand over part of\\\\r\\\\nthe map. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you read?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cARAT,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I read.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He raised his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBALLARAT.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\\\r\\\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\\\r\\\\nmurderer. So-and-so, of Ballarat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is wonderful!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I exclaimed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\\\r\\\\nconsiderably. The possession of a gray garment was a third point\\\\r\\\\nwhich, granting the son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We\\\\r\\\\nhave come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\\\\r\\\\nAustralian from Ballarat with a gray cloak.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the Pool can only be\\\\r\\\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\\\r\\\\nwander.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\\\r\\\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\\\\r\\\\nto the personality of the criminal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how did you gain them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observance of trifles.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\\\r\\\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, they were peculiar boots.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his lameness?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\\\\r\\\\nleft. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he was lame.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his left-handedness.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\\\\r\\\\nby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately\\\\r\\\\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it\\\\r\\\\nwere by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the\\\\r\\\\ninterview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found\\\\r\\\\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled\\\\r\\\\nme to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some\\\\r\\\\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\\\\r\\\\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found\\\\r\\\\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\\\\r\\\\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which\\\\r\\\\nare rolled in Rotterdam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the cigar-holder?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used\\\\r\\\\na holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\\\\r\\\\na clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he\\\\r\\\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as\\\\r\\\\nif you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in\\\\r\\\\nwhich all this points. The culprit is\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. John Turner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\\\r\\\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\\\r\\\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\\\\r\\\\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous\\\\r\\\\nlimbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and\\\\r\\\\nof character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding,\\\\r\\\\ndrooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\\\\r\\\\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\\\\r\\\\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear\\\\r\\\\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\\\r\\\\ndisease.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray sit down on the sofa,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, gently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had my note?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see\\\\r\\\\nme here to avoid scandal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why did you wish to see me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked across at my companion with\\\\r\\\\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is\\\\r\\\\nso. I know all about McCarthy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod help me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I\\\\r\\\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that\\\\r\\\\nI would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad to hear you say so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, gravely.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would\\\\r\\\\nbreak her heart\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it will break her heart when she hears that I am\\\\r\\\\narrested.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may not come to that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\\\\r\\\\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young\\\\r\\\\nMcCarthy must be got off, however.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am a dying man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said old Turner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have had diabetes for years. My\\\\r\\\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would\\\\r\\\\nrather die under my own roof than in a jail.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\\\\r\\\\nbundle of paper before him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust tell us the truth,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\r\\\\nshall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness\\\\r\\\\nit. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\\\\r\\\\nyoung McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely needed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s as well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the old man; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a question whether I shall live\\\\r\\\\nto the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare\\\\r\\\\nAlice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\\\\r\\\\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I\\\\r\\\\ntell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.\\\\r\\\\nHis grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my\\\\r\\\\nlife. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was in the early sixties at the diggings. I was a young chap then,\\\\r\\\\nhot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\\\\r\\\\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to\\\\r\\\\nthe bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway\\\\r\\\\nrobber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,\\\\r\\\\nsticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\\\\r\\\\nroad to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\\\\r\\\\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we\\\\r\\\\nlay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of\\\\r\\\\nus, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at\\\\r\\\\nthe first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we\\\\r\\\\ngot the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was\\\\r\\\\nthis very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then,\\\\r\\\\nbut I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face,\\\\r\\\\nas though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became\\\\r\\\\nwealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\\\\r\\\\nThere I parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a\\\\r\\\\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\\\\r\\\\nin the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\\\\r\\\\nto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\\\\r\\\\nthough my wife died young, she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\\\\r\\\\nshe was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\\\\r\\\\nas nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf, and\\\\r\\\\ndid my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy\\\\r\\\\nlaid his grip upon me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\\\\r\\\\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Here we are, Jack,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says he, touching me on the arm; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be as\\\\r\\\\ngood as a family to you. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two of us, me and my son, and you can\\\\r\\\\nhave the keeping of us. If you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a fine, law-abiding country\\\\r\\\\nis England, and there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always a policeman within hail.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, down they came to the West country, there was no shaking them\\\\r\\\\noff, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.\\\\r\\\\nThere was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I\\\\r\\\\nwould, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse\\\\r\\\\nas Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my\\\\r\\\\npast than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever\\\\r\\\\nit was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last\\\\r\\\\nhe asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\\\\r\\\\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad\\\\r\\\\nshould step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not\\\\r\\\\nhave his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to\\\\r\\\\nthe lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.\\\\r\\\\nMcCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at\\\\r\\\\nthe Pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked\\\\r\\\\na cigar, and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I\\\\r\\\\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to\\\\r\\\\ncome uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as\\\\r\\\\nlittle regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off\\\\r\\\\nthe streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most\\\\r\\\\ndear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\\\\r\\\\nbond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\\\\r\\\\nand fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my\\\\r\\\\nmemory and my girl! Both could be saved, if I could but silence that\\\\r\\\\nfoul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I\\\\r\\\\nhave sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\\\\r\\\\nmy girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\\\\r\\\\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if\\\\r\\\\nhe had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;\\\\r\\\\nbut I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\\\r\\\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true\\\\r\\\\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as the old man\\\\r\\\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI pray that we may\\\\r\\\\nnever be exposed to such a temptation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\\\\r\\\\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes.\\\\r\\\\nI will keep your confession, and, if McCarthy is condemned, I shall be\\\\r\\\\nforced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and\\\\r\\\\nyour secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFarewell, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the old man, solemnly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour own death-beds,\\\\r\\\\nwhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which\\\\r\\\\nyou have given to mine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame,\\\\r\\\\nhe stumbled slowly from the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod help us!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, after a long silence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy does fate play\\\\r\\\\nsuch tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\\\\r\\\\nthis that I do not think of Baxter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s words, and say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There, but for\\\\r\\\\nthe grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes, on the strength of a\\\\r\\\\nnumber of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes, and submitted\\\\r\\\\nto the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our\\\\r\\\\ninterview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son\\\\r\\\\nand daughter may come to live happily together, in ignorance of the\\\\r\\\\nblack cloud which rests upon their past.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure V\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\\\r\\\\nbetween the years \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9982 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9990, I am faced by so many which present\\\\r\\\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know\\\\r\\\\nwhich to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained\\\\r\\\\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field\\\\r\\\\nfor those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a\\\\r\\\\ndegree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\\\\r\\\\ntoo, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\\\\r\\\\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\\\\r\\\\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\\\\r\\\\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\\\\r\\\\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\\\\r\\\\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\\\\r\\\\nsome account of it, in spite of the fact that there are points in\\\\r\\\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\\\r\\\\nentirely cleared up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe year \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater\\\\r\\\\nor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings\\\\r\\\\nunder this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of\\\\r\\\\nthe Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a\\\\r\\\\nluxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the\\\\r\\\\nfacts connected with the loss of the British bark _Sophy Anderson_, of\\\\r\\\\nthe singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa,\\\\r\\\\nand finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may\\\\r\\\\nbe remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\\\\r\\\\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a deduction\\\\r\\\\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these\\\\r\\\\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such\\\\r\\\\nsingular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have\\\\r\\\\nnow taken up my pen to describe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had\\\\r\\\\nset in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the\\\\r\\\\nrain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart\\\\r\\\\nof great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the\\\\r\\\\ninstant from the routine of life, and to recognize the presence of\\\\r\\\\nthose great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars\\\\r\\\\nof his civilization, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in,\\\\r\\\\nthe storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a\\\\r\\\\nchild in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\\\\r\\\\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\\\\r\\\\ndeep in one of Clark Russell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fine sea-stories, until the howl of the\\\\r\\\\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\\\\r\\\\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was\\\\r\\\\non a visit to her mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\\\r\\\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, glancing up at my companion, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat was surely the bell.\\\\r\\\\nWho could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcept yourself I have none,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not encourage\\\\r\\\\nvisitors.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA client, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on\\\\r\\\\nsuch a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to\\\\r\\\\nbe some crony of the landlady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came\\\\r\\\\na step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his\\\\r\\\\nlong arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant\\\\r\\\\nchair upon which a new-comer must sit. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome in!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\\\r\\\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\\\r\\\\nin his bearing. The steaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and\\\\r\\\\nhis long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he\\\\r\\\\nhad come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and\\\\r\\\\nI could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a\\\\r\\\\nman who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI owe you an apology,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, raising his golden _pince-nez_ to his\\\\r\\\\neyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some\\\\r\\\\ntraces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive me your coat and umbrella,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey may rest here\\\\r\\\\non the hook, and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\\\\r\\\\nsouth-west, I see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, from Horsham.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe-caps is quite\\\\r\\\\ndistinctive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have come for advice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is easily got.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd help.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is not always so easy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how\\\\r\\\\nyou saved him in the Tankerville Club Scandal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe said that you could solve anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe said too much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat you are never beaten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been beaten four times\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94three times by men, and once by a\\\\r\\\\nwoman.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you may be so with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favor me with\\\\r\\\\nsome details as to your case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is no ordinary one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have\\\\r\\\\never listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events\\\\r\\\\nthan those which have happened in my own family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou fill me with interest,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray give us the essential\\\\r\\\\nfacts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\\\\r\\\\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe young man pulled his chair up, and pushed his wet feet out towards\\\\r\\\\nthe blaze.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far\\\\r\\\\nas I can understand it, little to do with this awful business. It is an\\\\r\\\\nhereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must\\\\r\\\\ngo back to the commencement of the affair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94my uncle Elias and\\\\r\\\\nmy father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which\\\\r\\\\nhe enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was the\\\\r\\\\npatentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with\\\\r\\\\nsuch success that he was able to sell it, and to retire upon a handsome\\\\r\\\\ncompetence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man, and\\\\r\\\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done\\\\r\\\\nvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s army, and\\\\r\\\\nafterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid\\\\r\\\\ndown his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained\\\\r\\\\nfor three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe,\\\\r\\\\nand took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was\\\\r\\\\nhis aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy\\\\r\\\\nin extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\\\\r\\\\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most\\\\r\\\\nretiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham I\\\\r\\\\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three\\\\r\\\\nfields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though\\\\r\\\\nvery often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank\\\\r\\\\na great deal of brandy, and smoked very heavily, but he would see no\\\\r\\\\nsociety, and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind me, in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\\\\r\\\\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be\\\\r\\\\nin the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\\\\r\\\\nbegged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me\\\\r\\\\nin his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon\\\\r\\\\nand draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with\\\\r\\\\nthe servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\\\\r\\\\nsixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys, and could\\\\r\\\\ngo where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\\\\r\\\\nin his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had\\\\r\\\\na single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably\\\\r\\\\nlocked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\\\\r\\\\nenter. With a boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s curiosity I have peeped through the key-hole, but\\\\r\\\\nI was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and\\\\r\\\\nbundles as would be expected in such a room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it was in March, 1883\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a letter with a foreign stamp lay\\\\r\\\\nupon the table in front of the Colonel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plate. It was not a common\\\\r\\\\nthing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in\\\\r\\\\nready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98From India!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he,\\\\r\\\\nas he took it up, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Opening\\\\r\\\\nit hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which\\\\r\\\\npattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh\\\\r\\\\nwas struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen,\\\\r\\\\nhis eyes were protruding, his skin the color of putty, and he glared at\\\\r\\\\nthe envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98K. K. K.!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\r\\\\nshrieked, and then, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What is it, uncle?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Death,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,\\\\r\\\\nleaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope, and saw\\\\r\\\\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter\\\\r\\\\nK three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried\\\\r\\\\npips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the\\\\r\\\\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with\\\\r\\\\nan old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,\\\\r\\\\nand a small brass box, like a cash-box, in the other.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98They may do what they like, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll checkmate them still,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he,\\\\r\\\\nwith an oath. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,\\\\r\\\\nand send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step\\\\r\\\\nup to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there\\\\r\\\\nwas a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\\\\r\\\\nbox stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,\\\\r\\\\nwith a start, that upon the lid were printed the treble K which I had\\\\r\\\\nread in the morning upon the envelope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I wish you, John,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said my uncle, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98to witness my will. I leave\\\\r\\\\nmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my\\\\r\\\\nbrother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\\\\r\\\\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my\\\\r\\\\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to\\\\r\\\\ngive you such a two-edged thing, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say what turn things are\\\\r\\\\ngoing to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\\\r\\\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression\\\\r\\\\nupon me, and I pondered over it, and turned it every way in my mind\\\\r\\\\nwithout being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\\\\r\\\\nthe vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation\\\\r\\\\ngrew less keen as the weeks passed, and nothing happened to disturb\\\\r\\\\nthe usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle,\\\\r\\\\nhowever. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any\\\\r\\\\nsort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the\\\\r\\\\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort\\\\r\\\\nof drunken frenzy, and would burst out of the house and tear about the\\\\r\\\\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid\\\\r\\\\nof no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,\\\\r\\\\nby man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\\\r\\\\ntumultuously in at the door, and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\\\\r\\\\nwho can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\\\\r\\\\nroots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\\\\r\\\\nday, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\\\\r\\\\nyour patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\\\\r\\\\nsallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\\\\r\\\\nsearch for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\\\\r\\\\nat the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\\\\r\\\\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\\\\r\\\\nknown eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. But I, who knew\\\\r\\\\nhow he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\\\\r\\\\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\\\\r\\\\nsome \\\\xc2\\\\xa314,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne moment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes interposed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour statement is, I foresee, one\\\\r\\\\nof the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the\\\\r\\\\ndate of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\\\\r\\\\nsupposed suicide.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe latter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\\\r\\\\nupon the night of May 2d.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. Pray proceed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\\\r\\\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\\\r\\\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\\\\r\\\\nthe inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\\\\r\\\\nK. repeated upon it, and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nwritten beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\\\\r\\\\nwhich had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\\\\r\\\\nnothing of much importance in the attic, save a great many scattered\\\\r\\\\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life in America. Some\\\\r\\\\nof them were of the war time, and showed that he had done his duty\\\\r\\\\nwell, and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a\\\\r\\\\ndate during the reconstruction of the Southern States, and were mostly\\\\r\\\\nconcerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in\\\\r\\\\nopposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the\\\\r\\\\nNorth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it was the beginning of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9984 when my father came to live at\\\\r\\\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January\\\\r\\\\nof \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a\\\\r\\\\nsharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There\\\\r\\\\nhe was, sitting with a newly-opened envelope in one hand and five dried\\\\r\\\\norange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always\\\\r\\\\nlaughed at what he called my cock-and-a-bull story about the Colonel,\\\\r\\\\nbut he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come\\\\r\\\\nupon himself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he stammered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy heart had turned to lead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is K. K. K.,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe looked inside the envelope. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98So it is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Here are the\\\\r\\\\nvery letters. But what is this written above them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Put the papers on the sundial,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What papers? What sundial?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but the\\\\r\\\\npapers must be those that are destroyed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Pooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98We are in a civilized\\\\r\\\\nland here, and we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the\\\\r\\\\nthing come from?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98From Dundee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, glancing at the post-mark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Some preposterous practical joke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What have I to do with\\\\r\\\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should certainly speak to the police,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then let me do so?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I forbid you. I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\\\\r\\\\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from\\\\r\\\\nhome to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command\\\\r\\\\nof one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\\\\r\\\\nfor it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\\\\r\\\\nfrom home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\\\\r\\\\nabsence I received a telegram from the Major, imploring me to come at\\\\r\\\\nonce. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\\\\r\\\\nin the neighborhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\\\\r\\\\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\\\\r\\\\nconsciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\\\\r\\\\nthe twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\\\r\\\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Death\\\\r\\\\nfrom accidental causes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Carefully as I examined every fact connected\\\\r\\\\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\\\\r\\\\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\\\\r\\\\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And\\\\r\\\\nyet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I\\\\r\\\\nwas wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why\\\\r\\\\nI did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that\\\\r\\\\nour troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nlife, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in\\\\r\\\\nanother.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was in January, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9985, that my poor father met his end, and two years\\\\r\\\\nand eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\\\\r\\\\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\\\\r\\\\naway from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\\\\r\\\\nhad begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\\\\r\\\\nfell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and, turning\\\\r\\\\nto the table, he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the envelope,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe post-mark is London\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94eastern\\\\r\\\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s last\\\\r\\\\nmessage: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98K. K. K.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99; and then \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Put the papers on the sundial.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have you done?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo tell the truth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he sank his face into his thin, white hands\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\r\\\\nhave felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when\\\\r\\\\nthe snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some\\\\r\\\\nresistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\\\\r\\\\nguard against.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTut! tut!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Sherlock Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must act, man, or you are lost.\\\\r\\\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen the police.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\\\\r\\\\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\\\r\\\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as\\\\r\\\\nthe jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIncredible imbecility!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\ncried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\\\r\\\\nhouse with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHas he come with you to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy did you come to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand, above all, why did you not\\\\r\\\\ncome at once?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\\\\r\\\\nabout my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\\\\r\\\\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which\\\\r\\\\nyou have placed before us\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94no suggestive detail which might help us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is one thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\\\r\\\\npocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored, blue-tinted paper, he\\\\r\\\\nlaid it out upon the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have some remembrance,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat\\\\r\\\\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\\\\r\\\\nunburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\\\\r\\\\ncolor. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am\\\\r\\\\ninclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\\\\r\\\\nfluttered out from among the others, and in that way have escaped\\\\r\\\\ndestruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\\\\r\\\\nmuch. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\\\\r\\\\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\\\r\\\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It\\\\r\\\\nwas headed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMarch, 1869,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and beneath were the following enigmatical\\\\r\\\\nnotices:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St.\\\\r\\\\nAugustine.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c9th. McCauley cleared.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c10th. John Swain cleared.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, folding up the paper, and returning it to\\\\r\\\\nour visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We\\\\r\\\\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get\\\\r\\\\nhome instantly and act.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat shall I do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put\\\\r\\\\nthis piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which\\\\r\\\\nyou have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the\\\\r\\\\nother papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only\\\\r\\\\none which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry\\\\r\\\\nconviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box\\\\r\\\\nout upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEntirely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\\\\r\\\\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to\\\\r\\\\nweave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to\\\\r\\\\nremove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear\\\\r\\\\nup the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you\\\\r\\\\nadvise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\\\r\\\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\\\r\\\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy train from Waterloo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you\\\\r\\\\nmay be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am armed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to\\\\r\\\\nthe box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nHe shook hands with us, and took his leave. Outside the wind still\\\\r\\\\nscreamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.\\\\r\\\\nThis strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad\\\\r\\\\nelements\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and now\\\\r\\\\nto have been reabsorbed by them once more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\\\\r\\\\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit\\\\r\\\\nhis pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings\\\\r\\\\nas they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked at last, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat of all our cases we have\\\\r\\\\nhad none more fantastic than this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to\\\\r\\\\nme to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut have you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cformed any definite conception as to what\\\\r\\\\nthese perils are?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere can be no question as to their nature,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\\\\r\\\\nunhappy family?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms\\\\r\\\\nof his chair, with his finger-tips together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe ideal reasoner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nremarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all\\\\r\\\\nits bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which\\\\r\\\\nled up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As\\\\r\\\\nCuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of\\\\r\\\\na single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link\\\\r\\\\nin a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the\\\\r\\\\nother ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results\\\\r\\\\nwhich the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the\\\\r\\\\nstudy which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the\\\\r\\\\naid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch,\\\\r\\\\nit is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the\\\\r\\\\nfacts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies,\\\\r\\\\nas you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even\\\\r\\\\nin these days of free education and encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dias, is a somewhat rare\\\\r\\\\naccomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\\\\r\\\\npossess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\\\\r\\\\nand this I have endeavored in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you\\\\r\\\\non one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\\\\r\\\\nin a very precise fashion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a singular document. Philosophy,\\\\r\\\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\\\\r\\\\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region\\\\r\\\\nwithin fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,\\\\r\\\\nsensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,\\\\r\\\\nswordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I\\\\r\\\\nthink, were the main points of my analysis.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say now, as I said\\\\r\\\\nthen, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\\\\r\\\\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away\\\\r\\\\nin the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants\\\\r\\\\nit. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us\\\\r\\\\nto-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand\\\\r\\\\nme down the letter K of the American Encyclop\\\\xc3\\\\xa6dia which stands upon\\\\r\\\\nthe shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation,\\\\r\\\\nand see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start\\\\r\\\\nwith a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong\\\\r\\\\nreason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all\\\\r\\\\ntheir habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida\\\\r\\\\nfor the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of\\\\r\\\\nsolitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one\\\\r\\\\nor something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear\\\\r\\\\nof some one or something which drove him from America. As to what it\\\\r\\\\nwas he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable\\\\r\\\\nletters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you\\\\r\\\\nremark the post-marks of those letters?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\\\r\\\\nfrom London.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent. We have already a clew. There can be no doubt that the\\\\r\\\\nprobability\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the strong probability\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94is that the writer was on board\\\\r\\\\nof a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of\\\\r\\\\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\\\\r\\\\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest\\\\r\\\\nanything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA greater distance to travel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I do not see the point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\\\\r\\\\nor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always sent their\\\\r\\\\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\\\\r\\\\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\\\\r\\\\nDundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would\\\\r\\\\nhave arrived almost as soon as their letter. But as a matter of fact\\\\r\\\\nseven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the\\\\r\\\\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the\\\\r\\\\nsailing-vessel which brought the writer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\\\\r\\\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has\\\\r\\\\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\\\\r\\\\ntravel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we\\\\r\\\\ncannot count upon delay.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance\\\\r\\\\nto the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite\\\\r\\\\nclear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not\\\\r\\\\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\njury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\\\\r\\\\nof resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the\\\\r\\\\nholder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\\\\r\\\\nthe initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut of what society?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you never\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking\\\\r\\\\nhis voice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere it\\\\r\\\\nis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, presently, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the\\\\r\\\\nfanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This\\\\r\\\\nterrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in\\\\r\\\\nthe Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local\\\\r\\\\nbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,\\\\r\\\\nLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used\\\\r\\\\nfor political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro\\\\r\\\\nvoters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who\\\\r\\\\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by\\\\r\\\\na warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally\\\\r\\\\nrecognized shape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or\\\\r\\\\norange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly\\\\r\\\\nabjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the\\\\r\\\\nmatter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some\\\\r\\\\nstrange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organization of the\\\\r\\\\nsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case\\\\r\\\\nupon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in\\\\r\\\\nwhich any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For\\\\r\\\\nsome years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the\\\\r\\\\nUnited States Government and of the better classes of the community in\\\\r\\\\nthe South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly\\\\r\\\\ncollapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort\\\\r\\\\nsince that date.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will observe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat the\\\\r\\\\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\\\\r\\\\nof Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\\\r\\\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\\\\r\\\\nmore implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this\\\\r\\\\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\\\\r\\\\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\\\\r\\\\nrecovered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen the page we have seen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98sent the\\\\r\\\\npips to A, B, and C,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is, sent the society\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s warning to them.\\\\r\\\\nThen there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the\\\\r\\\\ncountry, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister\\\\r\\\\nresult for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into\\\\r\\\\nthis dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has\\\\r\\\\nin the mean time is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more\\\\r\\\\nto be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin, and let\\\\r\\\\nus try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still\\\\r\\\\nmore miserable ways of our fellow-men.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\\\r\\\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have, I\\\\r\\\\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\\\r\\\\nOpenshaw\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat steps will you take?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\\\\r\\\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will not go there first?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I shall commence with the city. Just ring the bell, and the maid\\\\r\\\\nwill bring up your coffee.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced\\\\r\\\\nmy eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou are too late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, laying down his cup, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feared as much. How was it\\\\r\\\\ndone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tragedy near\\\\r\\\\nWaterloo Bridge.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Here is the account: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Between nine and ten last\\\\r\\\\nnight Police-constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo\\\\r\\\\nBridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help\\\\r\\\\nof several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.\\\\r\\\\nThe alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police,\\\\r\\\\nthe body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young\\\\r\\\\ngentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in\\\\r\\\\nhis pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It\\\\r\\\\nis conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last\\\\r\\\\ntrain from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme\\\\r\\\\ndarkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the\\\\r\\\\nsmall landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces\\\\r\\\\nof violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been\\\\r\\\\nthe victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect\\\\r\\\\nof calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the\\\\r\\\\nriver-side landing-stages.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\\\r\\\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a petty\\\\r\\\\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter\\\\r\\\\nwith me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this\\\\r\\\\ngang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him\\\\r\\\\naway to his death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room\\\\r\\\\nin uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a\\\\r\\\\nnervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey must be cunning devils,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he exclaimed, at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could they\\\\r\\\\nhave decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line\\\\r\\\\nto the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\\\r\\\\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in\\\\r\\\\nthe long run. I am going out now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I CRIED, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98YOU ARE TOO LATE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo the police?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take\\\\r\\\\nthe flies, but not before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the\\\\r\\\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\\\r\\\\nback yet. It was nearly ten o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock before he entered, looking pale\\\\r\\\\nand worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the\\\\r\\\\nloaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught\\\\r\\\\nof water.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are hungry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\\\r\\\\nbreakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how have you succeeded?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have a clew?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\\\r\\\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\\\r\\\\nupon them. It is well thought of!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and, tearing it to pieces, he\\\\r\\\\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five, and thrust\\\\r\\\\nthem into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cS. H. for J.\\\\r\\\\nO.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then he sealed it and addressed it to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCaptain James Calhoun, Bark\\\\r\\\\n_Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will await him when he enters port,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, chuckling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may\\\\r\\\\ngive him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his\\\\r\\\\nfate as Openshaw did before him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you trace it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates\\\\r\\\\nand names.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have spent the whole day,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cover Lloyd\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s registers and the\\\\r\\\\nfiles of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel\\\\r\\\\nwhich touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9983. There\\\\r\\\\nwere thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during\\\\r\\\\nthose months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my\\\\r\\\\nattention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from\\\\r\\\\nLondon, the name is that which is given to one of the States of the\\\\r\\\\nUnion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTexas, I think.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\\\r\\\\nAmerican origin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the bark _Lone\\\\r\\\\nStar_ was there in January, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9985, my suspicion became a certainty. I\\\\r\\\\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\\\\r\\\\nLondon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\\\r\\\\nDock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early\\\\r\\\\ntide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend,\\\\r\\\\nand learned that she had passed some time ago; and as the wind is\\\\r\\\\neasterly, I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins, and not\\\\r\\\\nvery far from the Isle of Wight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat will you do, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are, as I learn,\\\\r\\\\nthe only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and\\\\r\\\\nGermans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last\\\\r\\\\nnight. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By\\\\r\\\\nthe time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will\\\\r\\\\nhave carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police\\\\r\\\\nof Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a\\\\r\\\\ncharge of murder.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and\\\\r\\\\nthe murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips\\\\r\\\\nwhich would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as\\\\r\\\\nthemselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the\\\\r\\\\nequinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone\\\\r\\\\nStar_ of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that\\\\r\\\\nsomewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was\\\\r\\\\nseen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cL. S.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d carved\\\\r\\\\nupon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the\\\\r\\\\n_Lone Star_.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure VI\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\\\r\\\\nTheological College of St. George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, was much addicted to opium. The\\\\r\\\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he\\\\r\\\\nwas at college; for having read De Quincey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s description of his dreams\\\\r\\\\nand sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt\\\\r\\\\nto produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that\\\\r\\\\nthe practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years\\\\r\\\\nhe continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror\\\\r\\\\nand pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,\\\\r\\\\npasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\\\\r\\\\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94it was in June, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9989\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94there came a ring to my bell, about the\\\\r\\\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up\\\\r\\\\nin my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made\\\\r\\\\na little face of disappointment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA patient!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to go out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps\\\\r\\\\nupon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some\\\\r\\\\ndark-colored stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse my calling so late,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she began, and then, suddenly\\\\r\\\\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my\\\\r\\\\nwife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in such trouble!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nshe cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do so want a little help.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my wife, pulling up her veil, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is Kate Whitney. How you\\\\r\\\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d That was always\\\\r\\\\nthe way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\\\\r\\\\nlight-house.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\\\r\\\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you\\\\r\\\\nrather that I sent James off to bed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no, no! I want the Doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s advice and help, too. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about Isa.\\\\r\\\\nHe has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school\\\\r\\\\ncompanion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.\\\\r\\\\nDid she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring\\\\r\\\\nhim back to her?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt seemed that it was. She had the surest information that of late he\\\\r\\\\nhad, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest\\\\r\\\\neast of the city. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one\\\\r\\\\nday, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.\\\\r\\\\nBut now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay\\\\r\\\\nthere, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison\\\\r\\\\nor sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of\\\\r\\\\nit, at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBar of Gold,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to\\\\r\\\\ndo? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a\\\\r\\\\nplace, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded\\\\r\\\\nhim?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.\\\\r\\\\nMight I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,\\\\r\\\\nwhy should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s medical adviser, and\\\\r\\\\nas such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were\\\\r\\\\nalone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a\\\\r\\\\ncab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had\\\\r\\\\ngiven me. And so in ten minutes I had left my arm-chair and cheery\\\\r\\\\nsitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\\\\r\\\\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only\\\\r\\\\ncould show how strange it was to be.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.\\\\r\\\\nUpper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves\\\\r\\\\nwhich line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.\\\\r\\\\nBetween a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of\\\\r\\\\nsteps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the\\\\r\\\\nden of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down\\\\r\\\\nthe steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken\\\\r\\\\nfeet, and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found\\\\r\\\\nthe latch, and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy\\\\r\\\\nwith the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\\\r\\\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\\\r\\\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back\\\\r\\\\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye\\\\r\\\\nturned upon the new-comer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered\\\\r\\\\nlittle red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning\\\\r\\\\npoison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay\\\\r\\\\nsilent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in\\\\r\\\\na strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes,\\\\r\\\\nand then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own\\\\r\\\\nthoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbor. At the\\\\r\\\\nfarther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a\\\\r\\\\nthree-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw\\\\r\\\\nresting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into\\\\r\\\\nthe fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for\\\\r\\\\nme and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. I have not come to stay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is a friend of\\\\r\\\\nmine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and, peering\\\\r\\\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring\\\\r\\\\nout at me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy God! It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,\\\\r\\\\nwith every nerve in a twitter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say, Watson, what o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly eleven.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf what day?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf Friday, June 19th.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you\\\\r\\\\nwant to frighten a chap for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sank his face onto his arms, and began\\\\r\\\\nto sob in a high treble key.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\\\\r\\\\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I am. But you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\\\r\\\\nhours, three pipes, four pipes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I forget how many. But I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go home\\\\r\\\\nwith you. I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t frighten Kate\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94poor little Kate. Give me your\\\\r\\\\nhand! Have you a cab?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I have one waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\\\\r\\\\nWatson. I am all off color. I can do nothing for myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,\\\\r\\\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,\\\\r\\\\nand looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat\\\\r\\\\nby the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice\\\\r\\\\nwhispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWalk past me, and then look back at me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The words fell\\\\r\\\\nquite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come\\\\r\\\\nfrom the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,\\\\r\\\\nvery thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down\\\\r\\\\nfrom between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude\\\\r\\\\nfrom his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took\\\\r\\\\nall my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\\\\r\\\\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but\\\\r\\\\nI. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had\\\\r\\\\nregained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at\\\\r\\\\nmy surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight\\\\r\\\\nmotion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half\\\\r\\\\nround to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped\\\\r\\\\nsenility.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs low as you can,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have excellent ears. If you would\\\\r\\\\nhave the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\\\\r\\\\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have a cab outside.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\\\\r\\\\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you\\\\r\\\\nalso to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\\\\r\\\\nthrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with\\\\r\\\\nyou in five minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s requests, for they\\\\r\\\\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet\\\\r\\\\nair of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined\\\\r\\\\nin the cab my mission was practically accomplished, and for the rest,\\\\r\\\\nI could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend\\\\r\\\\nin one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of\\\\r\\\\nhis existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nbill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness.\\\\r\\\\nIn a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium\\\\r\\\\nden, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two\\\\r\\\\nstreets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then,\\\\r\\\\nglancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a\\\\r\\\\nhearty fit of laughter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you imagine that I have added\\\\r\\\\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\\\\r\\\\nweaknesses on which you have favored me with your medical views.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut not more so than I to find you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI came to find a friend.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I to find an enemy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn enemy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\\\r\\\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and\\\\r\\\\nI have hoped to find a clew in the incoherent ramblings of these\\\\r\\\\nsots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognized in that den my\\\\r\\\\nlife would not have been worth an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s purchase; for I have used it\\\\r\\\\nbefore now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has\\\\r\\\\nsworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of\\\\r\\\\nthat building, near the corner of Paul\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wharf, which could tell some\\\\r\\\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! You do not mean bodies?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAye, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 for every\\\\r\\\\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest\\\\r\\\\nmurder-trap on the whole river-side, and I fear that Neville St. Clair\\\\r\\\\nhas entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nHe put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\r\\\\nsignal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance,\\\\r\\\\nfollowed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nhoofs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\\\r\\\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\\\r\\\\nlanterns. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come with me, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I can be of use.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\\\r\\\\nMy room at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Cedars\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 is a double-bedded one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Cedars?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; that is Mr. St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. I am staying there while I conduct\\\\r\\\\nthe inquiry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere is it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am all in the dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course you are. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.\\\\r\\\\nAll right, John; we shall not need you. Here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s half a crown. Look out\\\\r\\\\nfor me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\\\r\\\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\\\r\\\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with\\\\r\\\\nthe murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\\\r\\\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\\\r\\\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\\\\r\\\\nbelated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the\\\\r\\\\nsky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts\\\\r\\\\nof the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\\\r\\\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside\\\\r\\\\nhim, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax\\\\r\\\\nhis powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\\\\r\\\\nhis thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get\\\\r\\\\nto the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\\\\r\\\\nshrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\\\\r\\\\nhas satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt makes you\\\\r\\\\nquite invaluable as a companion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Pon my word, it is a great thing\\\\r\\\\nfor me to have some one to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over\\\\r\\\\npleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman\\\\r\\\\nto-night when she meets me at the door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\\\\r\\\\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, I can get nothing\\\\r\\\\nto go upon. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the end\\\\r\\\\nof it into my hand. Now, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll state the case clearly and concisely to\\\\r\\\\nyou, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProceed, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome years ago\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94to be definite, in May, 1884\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94there came to Lee a\\\\r\\\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty\\\\r\\\\nof money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely,\\\\r\\\\nand lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the\\\\r\\\\nneighborhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by\\\\r\\\\nwhom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested\\\\r\\\\nin several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning,\\\\r\\\\nreturning by the 5.14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is\\\\r\\\\nnow thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good\\\\r\\\\nhusband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all\\\\r\\\\nwho know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\\\\r\\\\nas far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \\\\xc2\\\\xa388 10_s._, while\\\\r\\\\nhe has \\\\xc2\\\\xa3220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\\\r\\\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been\\\\r\\\\nweighing upon his mind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier\\\\r\\\\nthan usual, remarking before he started that he had two important\\\\r\\\\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\\\\r\\\\nbox of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\\\\r\\\\nupon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\\\\r\\\\nthat a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\\\\r\\\\nwas waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\\\\r\\\\nNow, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the offices\\\\r\\\\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\\\\r\\\\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\\\\r\\\\nstarted for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking\\\\r\\\\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed\\\\r\\\\nme so far?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very clear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.\\\\r\\\\nClair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as\\\\r\\\\nshe did not like the neighborhood in which she found herself. While\\\\r\\\\nshe was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\\\\r\\\\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\\\\r\\\\nat her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\\\\r\\\\nwindow. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\\\\r\\\\ndescribes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically\\\\r\\\\nto her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed\\\\r\\\\nto her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\\\r\\\\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was\\\\r\\\\nthat, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town\\\\r\\\\nin, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS SHE MET THIS LASCAR\\\\r\\\\nSCOUNDREL.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\\\r\\\\nsteps\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\\\\r\\\\nfound me to-night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and, running through the front room, she attempted\\\\r\\\\nto ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the\\\\r\\\\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\\\\r\\\\nwho thrust her back, and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\\\\r\\\\npushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\\\\r\\\\nand fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good-fortune, met, in\\\\r\\\\nFresno Street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\\\\r\\\\nway to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and,\\\\r\\\\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\\\\r\\\\nway to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\\\\r\\\\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\\\\r\\\\nto be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\\\\r\\\\nmade his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\\\r\\\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined\\\\r\\\\nwas their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come\\\\r\\\\nto believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded, when, with a cry, she\\\\r\\\\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid\\\\r\\\\nfrom it. Out there fell a cascade of children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bricks. It was the toy\\\\r\\\\nwhich he had promised to bring home.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\\\\r\\\\nmade the inspector realize that the matter was serious. The rooms were\\\\r\\\\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.\\\\r\\\\nThe front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a\\\\r\\\\nsmall bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.\\\\r\\\\nBetween the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is\\\\r\\\\ndry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and\\\\r\\\\na half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one, and opened\\\\r\\\\nfrom below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the\\\\r\\\\nwindow-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden\\\\r\\\\nfloor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room\\\\r\\\\nwere all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of\\\\r\\\\nhis coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94all were there.\\\\r\\\\nThere were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there\\\\r\\\\nwere no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he\\\\r\\\\nmust apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and\\\\r\\\\nthe ominous blood-stains upon the sill gave little promise that he\\\\r\\\\ncould save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at\\\\r\\\\nthe moment of the tragedy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\\\r\\\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\\\\r\\\\nbut as, by Mrs. St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story, he was known to have been at the\\\\r\\\\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s appearance\\\\r\\\\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\\\\r\\\\ncrime. His defense was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\\\\r\\\\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\\\\r\\\\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\\\\r\\\\ngentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s clothes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\\\r\\\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the\\\\r\\\\nlast human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name\\\\r\\\\nis Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every\\\\r\\\\nman who goes much to the city. He is a professional beggar, though,\\\\r\\\\nin order to avoid the police regulations, he pretends to a small\\\\r\\\\ntrade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street,\\\\r\\\\nupon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small\\\\r\\\\nangle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\\\r\\\\ncross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and, as he is\\\\r\\\\na piteous spectacle, a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\\\\r\\\\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the\\\\r\\\\nfellow more than once, before ever I thought of making his professional\\\\r\\\\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\\\\r\\\\nreaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\\\\r\\\\nno one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a\\\\r\\\\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction,\\\\r\\\\nhas turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a\\\\r\\\\npair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast\\\\r\\\\nto the color of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common\\\\r\\\\ncrowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready\\\\r\\\\nwith a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the\\\\r\\\\npassers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger\\\\r\\\\nat the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of\\\\r\\\\nwhom we are in quest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut a cripple!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat could he have done single-handed against\\\\r\\\\na man in the prime of life?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\\\r\\\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your\\\\r\\\\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\\\\r\\\\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray continue your narrative.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\\\r\\\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence\\\\r\\\\ncould be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton,\\\\r\\\\nwho had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\\\\r\\\\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\\\\r\\\\nmatter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\\\\r\\\\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\\\\r\\\\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\\\\r\\\\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\\\\r\\\\nincriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\\\\r\\\\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\\\\r\\\\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\\\\r\\\\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\\\\r\\\\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\\\\r\\\\nsource. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair,\\\\r\\\\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much\\\\r\\\\na mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assertion\\\\r\\\\nthat she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that\\\\r\\\\nshe must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\\\\r\\\\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\\\\r\\\\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\\\\r\\\\nclew.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\\\r\\\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat, and not Neville St.\\\\r\\\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think\\\\r\\\\nthey found in the pockets?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies\\\\r\\\\nand half-pennies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\\\\r\\\\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\\\\r\\\\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\\\\r\\\\nhouse. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\\\\r\\\\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\\\r\\\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that\\\\r\\\\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there\\\\r\\\\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?\\\\r\\\\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\\\\r\\\\ntell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\\\\r\\\\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\\\\r\\\\nsink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle down-stairs when\\\\r\\\\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\\\\r\\\\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\\\\r\\\\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret horde,\\\\r\\\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\\\\r\\\\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\\\\r\\\\nof the coat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\\\\r\\\\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\\\\r\\\\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt certainly sounds feasible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\\\r\\\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\\\\r\\\\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\\\\r\\\\nhim. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\\\\r\\\\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter\\\\r\\\\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94what\\\\r\\\\nNeville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him\\\\r\\\\nwhen there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\\\\r\\\\ndisappearance\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I\\\\r\\\\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\\\\r\\\\nglance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\\\\r\\\\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town\\\\r\\\\nuntil the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled\\\\r\\\\nalong with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights\\\\r\\\\nstill glimmered in the windows.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my companion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have touched\\\\r\\\\non three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\\\\r\\\\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light\\\\r\\\\namong the trees? That is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Cedars,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and beside that lamp sits a\\\\r\\\\nwoman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the\\\\r\\\\nclink of our horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nSt. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may\\\\r\\\\nrest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend\\\\r\\\\nand colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her\\\\r\\\\nhusband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own\\\\r\\\\ngrounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, and, springing\\\\r\\\\ndown, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to\\\\r\\\\nthe house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde\\\\r\\\\nwoman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de\\\\r\\\\nsoie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She\\\\r\\\\nstood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand\\\\r\\\\nupon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly\\\\r\\\\nbent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\\\r\\\\nstanding question.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And then, seeing that there were two of\\\\r\\\\nus, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo good news?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo bad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\\\r\\\\nlong day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\\\r\\\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\\\r\\\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am delighted to see you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she, pressing my hand warmly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\\\r\\\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly\\\\r\\\\nupon us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not,\\\\r\\\\nI can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\\\\r\\\\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\\\r\\\\nhappy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the lady, as we entered a well-lit\\\\r\\\\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\\\\r\\\\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, madam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\\\r\\\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUpon what point?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrankly,\\\\r\\\\nnow!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at\\\\r\\\\nhim as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou think that he is dead?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMurdered?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say that. Perhaps.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn Monday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\\\r\\\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he roared.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, to-day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in\\\\r\\\\nthe air.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMay I see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon\\\\r\\\\nthe table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently. I had left\\\\r\\\\nmy chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a\\\\r\\\\nvery coarse one, and was stamped with the Gravesend post-mark, and with\\\\r\\\\nthe date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was\\\\r\\\\nconsiderably after midnight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCoarse writing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d murmured Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSurely this is not your husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nwriting, madam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but the enclosure is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\\\\r\\\\ninquire as to the address.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow can you tell that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\\\r\\\\nThe rest is of the grayish color, which shows that blotting-paper has\\\\r\\\\nbeen used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none\\\\r\\\\nwould be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and\\\\r\\\\nthere has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only\\\\r\\\\nmean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but\\\\r\\\\nthere is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.\\\\r\\\\nHa! there has been an enclosure here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of his hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\\\\r\\\\nand yet I know it well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a\\\\r\\\\nhuge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\\\\r\\\\npatience.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Neville.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\\\\r\\\\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man\\\\r\\\\nwith a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very\\\\r\\\\nmuch in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have\\\\r\\\\nno doubt that it is your husband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, madam?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone. Neville wrote those words.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\\\\r\\\\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\\\\r\\\\nover.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The\\\\r\\\\nring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday, and only\\\\r\\\\nposted to-day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf so, much may have happened between.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well\\\\r\\\\nwith him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if\\\\r\\\\nevil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself\\\\r\\\\nin the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed up-stairs instantly\\\\r\\\\nwith the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think\\\\r\\\\nthat I would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his\\\\r\\\\ndeath?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may\\\\r\\\\nbe more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And\\\\r\\\\nin this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\\\\r\\\\ncorroborate your view. But if your husband is alive, and able to write\\\\r\\\\nletters, why should he remain away from you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery much so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas the window open?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen he might have called to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe might.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA call for help, you thought?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. He waved his hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\\\\r\\\\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe disappeared so suddenly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe might have leaped back. You did not see any one else in the room?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the\\\\r\\\\nLascar was at the foot of the stairs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\\\\r\\\\nclothes on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which\\\\r\\\\nI wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and\\\\r\\\\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\\\\r\\\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\\\\r\\\\nmy night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when\\\\r\\\\nhe had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even\\\\r\\\\nfor a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts,\\\\r\\\\nlooking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed\\\\r\\\\nit, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon\\\\r\\\\nevident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He\\\\r\\\\ntook off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown,\\\\r\\\\nand then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and\\\\r\\\\ncushions from the sofa and arm-chairs. With these he constructed a sort\\\\r\\\\nof Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\\\\r\\\\nounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.\\\\r\\\\nIn the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar\\\\r\\\\npipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\\\r\\\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with\\\\r\\\\nthe light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I\\\\r\\\\ndropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\\\\r\\\\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\\\\r\\\\npipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\\\\r\\\\nroom was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\\\\r\\\\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAwake, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGame for a morning drive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\\\\r\\\\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He chuckled to himself\\\\r\\\\nas he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\\\\r\\\\nsombre thinker of the previous night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\\\r\\\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished\\\\r\\\\nwhen Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the\\\\r\\\\nhorse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to test a little theory of mine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, pulling on his\\\\r\\\\nboots. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\\\\r\\\\none of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\\\\r\\\\nhere to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd where is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, smiling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the bath-room,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I am not joking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have just been there, and\\\\r\\\\nI have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\\\\r\\\\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe made our way down-stairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\\\\r\\\\nbright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with\\\\r\\\\nthe half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and\\\\r\\\\naway we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\\\\r\\\\nbearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\\\\r\\\\neither side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt has been in some points a singular case,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, flicking the\\\\r\\\\nhorse on into a gallop. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\\\\r\\\\nbut it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\\\\r\\\\ntheir windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\\\\r\\\\nPassing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\\\\r\\\\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right, and found\\\\r\\\\nourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the Force,\\\\r\\\\nand the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the\\\\r\\\\nhorse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head while the other led us in.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho is on duty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A tall, stout official had come down the\\\\r\\\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wish to\\\\r\\\\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\\\\r\\\\nand a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\\\\r\\\\ndesk.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI called about that beggarman, Boone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the one who was charged with\\\\r\\\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I heard. You have him here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the cells.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs he quiet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDirty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\\\\r\\\\nas black as a tinker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\\\\r\\\\nwill have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\\\\r\\\\nagree with me that he needed it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should like to see him very much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I think that I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He led us down a passage,\\\\r\\\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\\\r\\\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe third on the right is his,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the inspector. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere it is!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He\\\\r\\\\nquietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\\\\r\\\\nthrough.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is asleep,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can see him very well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\\\\r\\\\ntowards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\\\\r\\\\na middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored\\\\r\\\\nshirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the\\\\r\\\\ninspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his\\\\r\\\\nface could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an\\\\r\\\\nold scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction\\\\r\\\\nhad turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were\\\\r\\\\nexposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low\\\\r\\\\nover his eyes and forehead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a beauty, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the inspector.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe certainly needs a wash,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had an idea that he\\\\r\\\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened\\\\r\\\\nthe Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\\\\r\\\\nlarge bath-sponge.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe! he! You are a funny one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d chuckled the inspector.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\\\\r\\\\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the inspector. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look\\\\r\\\\na credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He slipped his key into\\\\r\\\\nthe lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\\\\r\\\\nturned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\\\\r\\\\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\\\\r\\\\ntwice vigorously across and down the prisoner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me introduce you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\\\\r\\\\nin the county of Kent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face peeled off\\\\r\\\\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\\\\r\\\\ntint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\\\\r\\\\nthe twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\\\\r\\\\ntwitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in\\\\r\\\\nhis bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\\\\r\\\\nsmooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy\\\\r\\\\nbewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a\\\\r\\\\nscream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the inspector, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is, indeed, the missing man.\\\\r\\\\nI know him from the photograph.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\\\\r\\\\nto his destiny. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe it so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd pray, what am I charged with?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Oh, come, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be\\\\r\\\\ncharged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid the inspector, with a grin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have been twenty-seven years\\\\r\\\\nin the force, but this really takes the cake.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\\\\r\\\\nbeen committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was not the wife, it was the children,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d groaned the prisoner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod\\\\r\\\\nhelp me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\\\r\\\\nexposure! What can I do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\\\r\\\\non the shoulder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\\\\r\\\\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\\\\r\\\\nyou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\\\\r\\\\nfind their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\\\\r\\\\nmake notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the\\\\r\\\\nproper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod bless you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the prisoner, passionately. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would have\\\\r\\\\nendured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my\\\\r\\\\nmiserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was\\\\r\\\\na school-master in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent\\\\r\\\\neducation. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally\\\\r\\\\nbecame a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor\\\\r\\\\nwished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis,\\\\r\\\\nand I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all\\\\r\\\\nmy adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur\\\\r\\\\nthat I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an\\\\r\\\\nactor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had\\\\r\\\\nbeen famous in the greenroom for my skill. I took advantage now of\\\\r\\\\nmy attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\\\\r\\\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist\\\\r\\\\nby the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster. Then with a red\\\\r\\\\nhead of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the\\\\r\\\\nbusiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a\\\\r\\\\nbeggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in\\\\r\\\\nthe evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than\\\\r\\\\n26_s._ 4_d._\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some\\\\r\\\\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon\\\\r\\\\nme for \\\\xc2\\\\xa325. I was at my wits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end where to get the money, but a sudden\\\\r\\\\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s grace from the creditor, asked\\\\r\\\\nfor a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\\\\r\\\\ncity under my disguise. In ten days I had the money, and had paid the\\\\r\\\\ndebt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous\\\\r\\\\nwork at \\\\xc2\\\\xa32 a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\\\\r\\\\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\\\\r\\\\nsitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money,\\\\r\\\\nbut the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day\\\\r\\\\nafter day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my\\\\r\\\\nghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew\\\\r\\\\nmy secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in\\\\r\\\\nSwandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar,\\\\r\\\\nand in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about\\\\r\\\\ntown. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that\\\\r\\\\nI knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\\\\r\\\\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \\\\xc2\\\\xa3700\\\\r\\\\na year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94which is less than my average takings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but I had exceptional\\\\r\\\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\\\\r\\\\nrepartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized\\\\r\\\\ncharacter in the city. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\\\\r\\\\npoured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xa32.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\\\\r\\\\nand eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my\\\\r\\\\nreal occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the city. She\\\\r\\\\nlittle knew what.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLast Monday I had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room\\\\r\\\\nabove the opium den, when I looked out of my window, and saw, to my\\\\r\\\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\\\\r\\\\nher eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\\\\r\\\\nto cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\\\\r\\\\nhim to prevent any one from coming up to me. I heard her voice\\\\r\\\\ndown-stairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\\\\r\\\\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\\\\r\\\\nwig. Even a wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\\\\r\\\\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\\\\r\\\\nthat the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening\\\\r\\\\nby my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\\\\r\\\\nbedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by\\\\r\\\\nthe coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag\\\\r\\\\nin which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\\\\r\\\\ndisappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\\\\r\\\\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\\\\r\\\\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead\\\\r\\\\nof being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\\\\r\\\\nmurderer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\\\r\\\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\\\r\\\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\\\r\\\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring, and confided it to the Lascar at a\\\\r\\\\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\\\\r\\\\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat note only reached her yesterday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood God! What a week she must have spent!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe police have watched this Lascar,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Inspector Bradstreet, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand\\\\r\\\\nI can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\\\\r\\\\nunobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\\\\r\\\\nforgot all about it for some days.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have no doubt of\\\\r\\\\nit. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must stop here, however,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Bradstreet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf the police are to\\\\r\\\\nhush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\\\\r\\\\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared\\\\r\\\\nthe matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI reached this one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my friend, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cby sitting upon five pillows and\\\\r\\\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\\\r\\\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure VII\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\\\r\\\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of\\\\r\\\\nthe season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,\\\\r\\\\na pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\\\\r\\\\nmorning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch\\\\r\\\\nwas a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy\\\\r\\\\nand disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\\\\r\\\\nin several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the\\\\r\\\\nchair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\\\\r\\\\npurpose of examination.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are engaged,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cperhaps I interrupt you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\\\\r\\\\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (he jerked his thumb in\\\\r\\\\nthe direction of the old hat), \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut there are points in connection with\\\\r\\\\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his\\\\r\\\\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\\\\r\\\\nthick with the ice crystals. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat, homely as\\\\r\\\\nit looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that it is\\\\r\\\\nthe clew which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the\\\\r\\\\npunishment of some crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no. No crime,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly one of\\\\r\\\\nthose whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have\\\\r\\\\nfour million human beings all jostling each other within the space of\\\\r\\\\na few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm\\\\r\\\\nof humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to\\\\r\\\\ntake place, and many a little problem will be presented which may\\\\r\\\\nbe striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had\\\\r\\\\nexperience of such.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat of the last six cases which I have\\\\r\\\\nadded to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\\\\r\\\\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of\\\\r\\\\nthe man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small\\\\r\\\\nmatter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,\\\\r\\\\nthe commissionaire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is his hat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look\\\\r\\\\nupon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem.\\\\r\\\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,\\\\r\\\\nin company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting\\\\r\\\\nat this moment in front of Peterson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fire. The facts are these: about\\\\r\\\\nfour o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a\\\\r\\\\nvery honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and\\\\r\\\\nwas making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him\\\\r\\\\nhe saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,\\\\r\\\\nand carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\\\\r\\\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\\\\r\\\\nlittle knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat, on\\\\r\\\\nwhich he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his\\\\r\\\\nhead, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward\\\\r\\\\nto protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\\\\r\\\\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\\\\r\\\\nuniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\\\\r\\\\nvanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\\\\r\\\\nTottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\\\\r\\\\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\\\\r\\\\nalso of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\\\\r\\\\nmost unimpeachable Christmas goose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98For Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nHenry Baker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nleft leg, and it is also true that the initials \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98H. B.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 are legible\\\\r\\\\nupon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\\\\r\\\\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy\\\\r\\\\nto restore lost property to any one of them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\\\r\\\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The\\\\r\\\\ngoose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in\\\\r\\\\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten\\\\r\\\\nwithout unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to\\\\r\\\\nfulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the\\\\r\\\\nhat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid he not advertise?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly as much as we can deduce.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom his hat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as\\\\r\\\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\\\\r\\\\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,\\\\r\\\\nhard, and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\\\\r\\\\nwas a good deal discolored. There was no maker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name; but, as Holmes\\\\r\\\\nhad remarked, the initials \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cH. B.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d were scrawled upon one side. It was\\\\r\\\\npierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\\\\r\\\\nthe rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\\\\r\\\\nplaces, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\\\\r\\\\ndiscolored patches by smearing them with ink.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can see nothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, handing it back to my friend.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\\\\r\\\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\\\\r\\\\nwhich was characteristic of him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is perhaps less suggestive than\\\\r\\\\nit might have been,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand yet there are a few inferences\\\\r\\\\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\\\\r\\\\nstrong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual\\\\r\\\\nis of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\\\\r\\\\nwell-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\\\\r\\\\nevil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\\\\r\\\\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\\\\r\\\\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\\\\r\\\\nwork upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\\\\r\\\\nhas ceased to love him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued,\\\\r\\\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is a man who leads a sedentary\\\\r\\\\nlife, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\\\\r\\\\nhas grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and\\\\r\\\\nwhich he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which\\\\r\\\\nare to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely\\\\r\\\\nimprobable that he has gas laid on in his house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\\\\r\\\\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am\\\\r\\\\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\\\r\\\\nintellectual?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\\\r\\\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a question\\\\r\\\\nof cubic capacity,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca man with so large a brain must have\\\\r\\\\nsomething in it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\\\\r\\\\nin then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\\\r\\\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\\\\r\\\\nso expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\\\\r\\\\nhas assuredly gone down in the world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\\\\r\\\\nthe moral retrogression?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is the foresight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, putting\\\\r\\\\nhis finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\r\\\\nare never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\\\\r\\\\ncertain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\\\\r\\\\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\\\\r\\\\nelastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he\\\\r\\\\nhas less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\\\\r\\\\nweakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some\\\\r\\\\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a\\\\r\\\\nsign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\\\\r\\\\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all\\\\r\\\\nto be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the\\\\r\\\\nlining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by\\\\r\\\\nthe scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there\\\\r\\\\nis a distinct odor of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not\\\\r\\\\nthe gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the\\\\r\\\\nhouse, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time;\\\\r\\\\nwhile the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the\\\\r\\\\nwearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the\\\\r\\\\nbest of training.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you said that she had ceased to love him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\\\\r\\\\nWatson, with a week\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your\\\\r\\\\nwife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also\\\\r\\\\nhave been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s affection.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he might be a bachelor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\\\r\\\\nRemember the card upon the bird\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leg.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\\\\r\\\\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\\\r\\\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that\\\\r\\\\nthe individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning\\\\r\\\\ntallow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94walks up-stairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and\\\\r\\\\na guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains\\\\r\\\\nfrom a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is very ingenious,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, laughing; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut since, as you said\\\\r\\\\njust now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done, save\\\\r\\\\nthe loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew\\\\r\\\\nopen, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with\\\\r\\\\nflushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\\\\r\\\\nthe kitchen window?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get\\\\r\\\\na fairer view of the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s excited face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He held out\\\\r\\\\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\\\\r\\\\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of\\\\r\\\\nsuch purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the\\\\r\\\\ndark hollow of his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy Jove, Peterson!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\\\\r\\\\nputty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot the Countess of Morcar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blue carbuncle!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\\\\r\\\\nread the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It\\\\r\\\\nis absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the\\\\r\\\\nreward offered of \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the\\\\r\\\\nmarket price.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The commissionaire plumped\\\\r\\\\ndown into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\\\\r\\\\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce the\\\\r\\\\ncountess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the\\\\r\\\\ngem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hotel Cosmopolitan,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\r\\\\nremarked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago. John Horner,\\\\r\\\\na plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has\\\\r\\\\nbeen referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here,\\\\r\\\\nI believe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,\\\\r\\\\nuntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing paragraph:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\\\\r\\\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst. abstracted from\\\\r\\\\nthe jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the\\\\r\\\\nblue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his\\\\r\\\\nevidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\\\\r\\\\nof the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that\\\\r\\\\nhe might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\\\\r\\\\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\\\\r\\\\naway. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\\\\r\\\\nbureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\\\\r\\\\nwhich, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep\\\\r\\\\nher jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly\\\\r\\\\ngave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\\\\r\\\\ncould not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine\\\\r\\\\nCusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cry of\\\\r\\\\ndismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\\\\r\\\\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector\\\\r\\\\nBradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\\\\r\\\\nstruggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\\\\r\\\\nterms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\\\\r\\\\nagainst the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with\\\\r\\\\nthe offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown\\\\r\\\\nsigns of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the\\\\r\\\\nconclusion, and was carried out of court.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum! So much for the police-court,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, thoughtfully, tossing\\\\r\\\\naside the paper. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence\\\\r\\\\nof events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of\\\\r\\\\na goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our\\\\r\\\\nlittle deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\\\\r\\\\ninnocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\\\\r\\\\nthe goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat\\\\r\\\\nand all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now\\\\r\\\\nwe must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and\\\\r\\\\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do\\\\r\\\\nthis, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\\\\r\\\\nin an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fails, I shall\\\\r\\\\nhave recourse to other methods.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat will you say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Found at the\\\\r\\\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker\\\\r\\\\ncan have the same by applying at 6.30 this evening at 221B,\\\\r\\\\nBaker Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 That is clear and concise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery. But will he see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\\\\r\\\\nthe loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance\\\\r\\\\nin breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson, that he\\\\r\\\\nthought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly\\\\r\\\\nregretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again,\\\\r\\\\nthe introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one\\\\r\\\\nwho knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson,\\\\r\\\\nrun down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening\\\\r\\\\npapers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn which, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s_, _Evening\\\\r\\\\nNews_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well, sir. And this stone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson,\\\\r\\\\njust buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we\\\\r\\\\nmust have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\\\r\\\\nfamily is now devouring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held\\\\r\\\\nit against the light. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bonny thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust see how it\\\\r\\\\nglints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\\\\r\\\\nEvery good stone is. They are the devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pet baits. In the larger and\\\\r\\\\nolder jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not\\\\r\\\\nyet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\\\\r\\\\nSouthern China, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\\\\r\\\\ncarbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red. In spite\\\\r\\\\nof its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two\\\\r\\\\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\\\\r\\\\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.\\\\r\\\\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\\\\r\\\\nand the prison? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lock it up in my strong box now, and drop a line\\\\r\\\\nto the countess to say that we have it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot tell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\\\r\\\\nanything to do with the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\\\\r\\\\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\\\\r\\\\nof considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer\\\\r\\\\nto our advertisement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you can do nothing until then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\\\\r\\\\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like\\\\r\\\\nto see the solution of so tangled a business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\\\\r\\\\nBy-the-way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nHudson to examine its crop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past\\\\r\\\\nsix when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached\\\\r\\\\nthe house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\\\\r\\\\nbuttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\\\\r\\\\nwas thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived, the door was opened,\\\\r\\\\nand we were shown up together to Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, rising from his arm-chair, and\\\\r\\\\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\\\\r\\\\nreadily assume. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a\\\\r\\\\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\\\\r\\\\nsummer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\\\\r\\\\ntime. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a\\\\r\\\\nbroad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled\\\\r\\\\nbrown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his\\\\r\\\\nextended hand, recalled Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surmise as to his habits. His rusty\\\\r\\\\nblack frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned\\\\r\\\\nup, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of\\\\r\\\\ncuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words\\\\r\\\\nwith care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\\\\r\\\\nletters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have retained these things for some days,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause we\\\\r\\\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at\\\\r\\\\na loss to know now why you did not advertise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShillings have not been\\\\r\\\\nso plentiful with me as they once were,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had no doubt\\\\r\\\\nthat the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat\\\\r\\\\nand the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt\\\\r\\\\nat recovering them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery naturally. By-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\\\\r\\\\nit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo eat it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so. But\\\\r\\\\nI presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\\\\r\\\\nsame weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, certainly, certainly;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered Mr. Baker, with a sigh of relief.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\\\\r\\\\nown bird, so if you wish\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey might be useful to me as\\\\r\\\\nrelics of my adventure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut beyond that I can hardly see\\\\r\\\\nwhat use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\\\\r\\\\nto me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\\\\r\\\\nattentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\\\\r\\\\nshoulders.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy-the-way,\\\\r\\\\nwould it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\\\\r\\\\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\\\\r\\\\ngoose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained\\\\r\\\\nproperty under his arm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a few of us who frequent the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha\\\\r\\\\nInn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 near the Museum\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94we are to be found in the Museum itself during\\\\r\\\\nthe day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\\\\r\\\\ninstituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\\\\r\\\\nevery week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\\\\r\\\\nduly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\\\\r\\\\nsir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\\\\r\\\\nstrode off upon his way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, when he had closed the door\\\\r\\\\nbehind him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\\\\r\\\\nthe matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot particularly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up\\\\r\\\\nthis clew while it is still hot.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy all means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\\\\r\\\\nabout our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\\\\r\\\\ncloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\\\\r\\\\nlike so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly\\\\r\\\\nas we swung through the Doctors\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley\\\\r\\\\nStreet, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter\\\\r\\\\nof an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlpha Inn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d which is a small\\\\r\\\\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\\\\r\\\\nHolborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered\\\\r\\\\ntwo glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy geese!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The man seemed surprised.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was\\\\r\\\\na member of your goose club.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not _our_ geese.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! Whose, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBreckinridge is his name.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know him. Well, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your good health, landlord, and\\\\r\\\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we\\\\r\\\\ncame out into the frosty air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRemember, Watson, that though we have\\\\r\\\\nso homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\\\\r\\\\nother a man who will certainly get seven years\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 penal servitude unless\\\\r\\\\nwe can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\\\\r\\\\nconfirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\\\\r\\\\nwhich has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\\\\r\\\\nplaced in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\\\\r\\\\nthe south, then, and quick march!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\\\\r\\\\nof slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\\\\r\\\\nname of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man,\\\\r\\\\nwith a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up\\\\r\\\\nthe shutters.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-evening. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a cold night,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSold out of geese, I see,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\\\\r\\\\nslabs of marble.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet you have 500 to-morrow morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, but I was recommended to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho by?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe landlord of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, then, mister,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, with his head cocked and his arms\\\\r\\\\nakimbo, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat are you driving at? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s have it straight, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\\\\r\\\\nwhich you supplied to the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, I sha\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell you. So now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why you should\\\\r\\\\nbe so warm over such a trifle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWarm! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When\\\\r\\\\nI pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\\\\r\\\\nbusiness; but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where are the geese?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Who did you sell the\\\\r\\\\ngeese to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What will you take for the geese?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 One would think they\\\\r\\\\nwere the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\\\\r\\\\nthem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\\\\r\\\\ninquiries,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, carelessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell us the bet is\\\\r\\\\noff, that is all. But I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\\\\r\\\\nof fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost your fiver, for it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s town bred,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped the\\\\r\\\\nsalesman.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing of the kind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say it is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them\\\\r\\\\never since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 were town bred.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never persuade me to believe that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you bet, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\r\\\\nhave a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBring me the books, Bill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\\\\r\\\\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the salesman, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought that I was out\\\\r\\\\nof geese, but before I finish you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll find that there is still one left\\\\r\\\\nin my shop. You see this little book?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you see? Well, then,\\\\r\\\\nhere on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\\\\r\\\\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then!\\\\r\\\\nYou see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town\\\\r\\\\nsuppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94249,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d read Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere you are, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mrs. Oakshott,\\\\r\\\\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, then, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the last entry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98December 22. Twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Sold to Mr. Windigate of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 at 12_s._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have you to say now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\\\r\\\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of\\\\r\\\\na man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped\\\\r\\\\nunder a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which\\\\r\\\\nwas peculiar to him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98pink \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98un\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nhe. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dare say that if I had put \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 down in front of him, that man\\\\r\\\\nwould not have given me such complete information as was drawn from\\\\r\\\\nhim by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we\\\\r\\\\nare, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which\\\\r\\\\nremains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nOakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is\\\\r\\\\nclear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides\\\\r\\\\nourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\\\r\\\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little\\\\r\\\\nrat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\\\\r\\\\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman,\\\\r\\\\nframed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the\\\\r\\\\ncringing figure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had enough of you and your geese,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wish you were\\\\r\\\\nall at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your\\\\r\\\\nsilly talk I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\\\\r\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese\\\\r\\\\noff you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whined the little man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe told me to ask you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had enough\\\\r\\\\nof it. Get out of this!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer\\\\r\\\\nflitted away into the darkness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome\\\\r\\\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Striding\\\\r\\\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\\\\r\\\\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him\\\\r\\\\nupon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight\\\\r\\\\nthat every vestige of color had been driven from his face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho are you, then? What do you want?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, in a quavering voice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, blandly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I could not help\\\\r\\\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I\\\\r\\\\nthink that I could be of assistance to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\\\\r\\\\npeople don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you can know nothing of this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavoring to trace some\\\\r\\\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\\\r\\\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Alpha,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nand by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the\\\\r\\\\nlittle fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\r\\\\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn that case\\\\r\\\\nwe had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept\\\\r\\\\nmarket-place,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it\\\\r\\\\nis that I have the pleasure of assisting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is John Robinson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nanswered, with a sidelong glance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; the real name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, sweetly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is always awkward\\\\r\\\\ndoing business with an _alias_.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nhe, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy real name is James Ryder.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hotel Cosmopolitan.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Pray step\\\\r\\\\ninto the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\\\\r\\\\nwould wish to know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\\\\r\\\\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\\\\r\\\\nis on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into\\\\r\\\\nthe cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\\\\r\\\\nStreet. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\\\\r\\\\nbreathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\\\\r\\\\nhis hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere we are!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe\\\\r\\\\nfire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.\\\\r\\\\nPray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\\\r\\\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what\\\\r\\\\nbecame of those geese?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine, in\\\\r\\\\nwhich you were interested\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94white, with a black bar across the tail.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRyder quivered with emotion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccan you tell me\\\\r\\\\nwhere it went to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt came here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wonder that you\\\\r\\\\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the\\\\r\\\\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here\\\\r\\\\nin my museum.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantel-piece with\\\\r\\\\nhis right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue\\\\r\\\\ncarbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\\\\r\\\\nmany-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\\\\r\\\\nwhether to claim or to disown it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe game\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up, Ryder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHold up, man, or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\r\\\\nbe into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not\\\\r\\\\ngot blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of\\\\r\\\\nbrandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to\\\\r\\\\nbe sure!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\\\\r\\\\na tinge of color into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\\\\r\\\\neyes at his accuser.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\\\\r\\\\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that\\\\r\\\\nlittle may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had\\\\r\\\\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, in a crackling\\\\r\\\\nvoice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94her ladyship\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden\\\\r\\\\nwealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\\\\r\\\\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\\\\r\\\\nyou used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\\\\r\\\\npretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\\\\r\\\\nbeen concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\\\\r\\\\nrest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\\\\r\\\\nsmall job in my lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you and your confederate Cusack\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and you\\\\r\\\\nmanaged that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\\\\r\\\\nrifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\\\\r\\\\narrested. You then\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, have mercy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shrieked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThink\\\\r\\\\nof my father! of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went\\\\r\\\\nwrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll swear it on a Bible.\\\\r\\\\nOh, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bring it into court! For Christ\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet back into your chair!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, sternly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very well to\\\\r\\\\ncringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\\\\r\\\\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\\\\r\\\\nagainst him will break down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of\\\\r\\\\nthe next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\\\\r\\\\ninto the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\\\\r\\\\nof safety.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98HAVE MERCY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 HE SHRIEKED\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will tell you it\\\\r\\\\njust as it happened, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Horner had been arrested, it\\\\r\\\\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone\\\\r\\\\nat once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take\\\\r\\\\nit into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about\\\\r\\\\nthe hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission,\\\\r\\\\nand I made for my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. She had married a man named Oakshott,\\\\r\\\\nand lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.\\\\r\\\\nAll the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\\\\r\\\\ndetective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\\\\r\\\\ndown my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\\\\r\\\\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\\\\r\\\\nupset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\\\\r\\\\nand smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\\\r\\\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell\\\\r\\\\ninto talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\\\\r\\\\nthey stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\\\\r\\\\nthings about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\\\\r\\\\nhe lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to\\\\r\\\\nturn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought\\\\r\\\\nof the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might\\\\r\\\\nat any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone\\\\r\\\\nin my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time,\\\\r\\\\nand looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\\\\r\\\\nbest detective that ever lived.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\\\\r\\\\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as\\\\r\\\\ngood as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry\\\\r\\\\nmy stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind\\\\r\\\\nthis I drove one of the birds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a fine big one, white, with a barred\\\\r\\\\ntail. I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down\\\\r\\\\nits throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I\\\\r\\\\nfelt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the\\\\r\\\\ncreature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what\\\\r\\\\nwas the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and\\\\r\\\\nfluttered off among the others.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says she.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you said you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\\\r\\\\nfeeling which was the fattest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve set yours aside for you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Jem\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bird, we call\\\\r\\\\nit. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the big white one over yonder. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twenty-six of them,\\\\r\\\\nwhich makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Thank you, Maggie,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 says I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but if it is all the same to you, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\r\\\\nrather have that one I was handling just now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The other is a good three pound heavier,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and we fattened\\\\r\\\\nit expressly for you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Never mind. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have the other, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take it now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, just as you like,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, a little huffed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Which is it you\\\\r\\\\nwant, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\\\\r\\\\nflock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\\\\r\\\\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that\\\\r\\\\nit was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked,\\\\r\\\\nand we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for\\\\r\\\\nthere was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\\\\r\\\\nhad occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and hurried\\\\r\\\\ninto the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where are they all, Maggie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Gone to the dealer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, Jem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Which dealer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But was there another with a barred tail?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98the same as the\\\\r\\\\none I chose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell\\\\r\\\\nthem apart.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\\\\r\\\\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at\\\\r\\\\nonce, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You\\\\r\\\\nheard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like\\\\r\\\\nthat. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I\\\\r\\\\nam myself. And now\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\\\\r\\\\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!\\\\r\\\\nGod help me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\\\\r\\\\nhis hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by\\\\r\\\\nthe measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s finger-tips upon the edge of\\\\r\\\\nthe table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat, sir! Oh, heaven bless you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo more words. Get out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\\\r\\\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\\\\r\\\\nfrom the street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter all, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\\\r\\\\npipe, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\\\r\\\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\\\\r\\\\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am\\\\r\\\\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\\\\r\\\\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\\\\r\\\\nSend him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life. Besides,\\\\r\\\\nit is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most\\\\r\\\\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.\\\\r\\\\nIf you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will\\\\r\\\\nbegin another investigation, in which, also, a bird will be the chief\\\\r\\\\nfeature.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure VIII\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\\\\r\\\\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\\\\r\\\\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\\\\r\\\\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\\\\r\\\\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\\\\r\\\\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\\\\r\\\\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\\\\r\\\\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\\\\r\\\\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It\\\\r\\\\nis possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\\\\r\\\\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\\\\r\\\\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\\\\r\\\\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\\\\r\\\\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are wide-spread\\\\r\\\\nrumors as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\\\\r\\\\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was early in April in the year \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9983 that I woke one morning to find\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\\\\r\\\\na late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed\\\\r\\\\nme that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some\\\\r\\\\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\\\\r\\\\nregular in my habits.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the common lot\\\\r\\\\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\\\\r\\\\nand I on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it, then\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a fire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\\\r\\\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in\\\\r\\\\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis\\\\r\\\\nat this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their\\\\r\\\\nbeds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\\\r\\\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\\\r\\\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\\\\r\\\\nshould call you and give you the chance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\\\r\\\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\\\\r\\\\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he\\\\r\\\\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\\\\r\\\\nmy clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\\\\r\\\\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\\\\r\\\\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-morning, madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, cheerily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Sherlock\\\\r\\\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\\\r\\\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\\\\r\\\\nthat Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\\\\r\\\\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\\\\r\\\\nyou are shivering.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the woman, in a low voice,\\\\r\\\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She raised her veil as she\\\\r\\\\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\\\\r\\\\nagitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes,\\\\r\\\\nlike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\\\\r\\\\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her\\\\r\\\\nexpression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\\\\r\\\\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must not fear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting\\\\r\\\\nher forearm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\\\\r\\\\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know me, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\\\\r\\\\nyour left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\\\\r\\\\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe left arm\\\\r\\\\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\\\\r\\\\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\\\\r\\\\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\\\\r\\\\nside of the driver.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\r\\\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\\\\r\\\\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\\\\r\\\\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94none,\\\\r\\\\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\\\\r\\\\naid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\\\\r\\\\nher that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\\\\r\\\\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\\\\r\\\\ndarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\\\\r\\\\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\\\\r\\\\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not\\\\r\\\\nfind me ungrateful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes turned to his desk, and unlocking it, drew out a small\\\\r\\\\ncase-book, which he consulted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFarintosh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\\\\r\\\\nan opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\\\\r\\\\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as\\\\r\\\\nI did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\\\\r\\\\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\\\\r\\\\nto, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\\\\r\\\\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\\\\r\\\\nmatter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied our visitor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe very horror of my situation lies\\\\r\\\\nin the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\\\\r\\\\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\\\\r\\\\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\\\\r\\\\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\\\\r\\\\nnervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\\\\r\\\\nanswers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\\\\r\\\\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\\\\r\\\\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am all attention, madam.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my step-father, who is\\\\r\\\\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\\\\r\\\\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes nodded his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe name is familiar to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\\\\r\\\\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\\\\r\\\\nHampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\\\\r\\\\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family\\\\r\\\\nruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the\\\\r\\\\nRegency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\\\\r\\\\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\\\\r\\\\nmortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living\\\\r\\\\nthe horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\\\\r\\\\nstep-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\\\\r\\\\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\\\\r\\\\nmedical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\\\\r\\\\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice.\\\\r\\\\nIn a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\\\\r\\\\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and\\\\r\\\\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long\\\\r\\\\nterm of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to England a morose and\\\\r\\\\ndisappointed man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\\\r\\\\nyoung widow of Major-general Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\\\r\\\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\\\\r\\\\nmy mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94not less\\\\r\\\\nthan \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 a year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\\\\r\\\\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\\\\r\\\\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\\\\r\\\\nafter our return to England my mother died\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94she was killed eight years\\\\r\\\\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\\\\r\\\\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to\\\\r\\\\nlive with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money\\\\r\\\\nwhich my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed\\\\r\\\\nto be no obstacle to our happiness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.\\\\r\\\\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who\\\\r\\\\nhad at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\\\\r\\\\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came\\\\r\\\\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\\\\r\\\\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\\\\r\\\\nthe men of the family, and in my step-father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s case it had, I believe,\\\\r\\\\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\\\\r\\\\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\\\\r\\\\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks\\\\r\\\\nwould fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\\\\r\\\\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\\\\r\\\\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no\\\\r\\\\nfriends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these\\\\r\\\\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\\\\r\\\\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\\\\r\\\\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\\\\r\\\\nweeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\\\\r\\\\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\\\\r\\\\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the\\\\r\\\\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\\\r\\\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a\\\\r\\\\nlong time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the\\\\r\\\\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\\\\r\\\\nas mine has.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour sister is dead, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\\\\r\\\\nspeak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have\\\\r\\\\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\\\\r\\\\nposition. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s maiden sister, Miss\\\\r\\\\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\\\\r\\\\nallowed to pay short visits at this lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. Julia went there at\\\\r\\\\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines,\\\\r\\\\nto whom she became engaged. My step-father learned of the engagement\\\\r\\\\nwhen my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but\\\\r\\\\nwithin a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\\\\r\\\\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\\\r\\\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\\\\r\\\\nglanced across at his visitor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray be precise as to details,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\\\\r\\\\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\\\\r\\\\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are\\\\r\\\\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\\\\r\\\\nthe buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, the second\\\\r\\\\nmy sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and the third my own. There is no communication between\\\\r\\\\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself\\\\r\\\\nplain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerfectly so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal\\\\r\\\\nnight Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\\\\r\\\\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of\\\\r\\\\nthe strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left\\\\r\\\\nher room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\\\\r\\\\nchatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock she rose to\\\\r\\\\nleave me but she paused at the door and looked back.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell me, Helen,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98have you ever heard any one whistle in\\\\r\\\\nthe dead of the night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Never,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\\\\r\\\\nsleep?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Certainly not. But why?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in\\\\r\\\\nthe morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it\\\\r\\\\nhas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94perhaps from the\\\\r\\\\nnext room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\\\\r\\\\nwhether you had heard it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\\\\r\\\\nnot hear it also.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 She smiled back at\\\\r\\\\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\\\\r\\\\nlock.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in\\\\r\\\\nat night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlways.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd why?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a\\\\r\\\\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\\\\r\\\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\\\r\\\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\\\r\\\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\\\\r\\\\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\\\\r\\\\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\\\\r\\\\nwoman. I knew that it was my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. I sprang from my bed,\\\\r\\\\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\\\\r\\\\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\\\\r\\\\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\\\\r\\\\nAs I ran down the passage, my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door was unlocked, and revolved\\\\r\\\\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\\\\r\\\\nwhat was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\\\\r\\\\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\\\\r\\\\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\\\\r\\\\nof a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\\\\r\\\\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\\\\r\\\\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\\\r\\\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I\\\\r\\\\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\\\\r\\\\nforget, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 There\\\\r\\\\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\\\\r\\\\nher finger into the air in the direction of the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room, but a\\\\r\\\\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\\\\r\\\\nloudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his\\\\r\\\\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side she was unconscious,\\\\r\\\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\\\\r\\\\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\\\\r\\\\ndied without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\\\\r\\\\nend of my beloved sister.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne moment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9care you sure about this whistle and\\\\r\\\\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\\\\r\\\\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\\\\r\\\\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas your sister dressed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\\\\r\\\\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\\\\r\\\\nalarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\\\\r\\\\ncoroner come to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s conduct\\\\r\\\\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\\\\r\\\\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had\\\\r\\\\nbeen fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\\\\r\\\\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\\\\r\\\\nnight. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\\\\r\\\\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\\\\r\\\\nthe same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\\\\r\\\\nstaples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\\\\r\\\\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow about poison?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\\\\r\\\\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere there gypsies in the plantation at the time?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there are nearly always some there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a speckled\\\\r\\\\nband?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\\\r\\\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\\\r\\\\nthese very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\\\r\\\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\\\r\\\\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese are very deep waters,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpray go on with your narrative.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\\\\r\\\\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\\\\r\\\\nknown for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.\\\\r\\\\nHis name is Armitage\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Percy Armitage\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the second son of Mr. Armitage,\\\\r\\\\nof Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition\\\\r\\\\nto the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two\\\\r\\\\ndays ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,\\\\r\\\\nand my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into\\\\r\\\\nthe chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in\\\\r\\\\nwhich she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,\\\\r\\\\nas I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in\\\\r\\\\nthe silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of\\\\r\\\\nher own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be\\\\r\\\\nseen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I\\\\r\\\\ndressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart\\\\r\\\\nat the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Crown Inn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from\\\\r\\\\nwhence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you\\\\r\\\\nand asking your advice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have done wisely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my friend. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut have you told me all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-father.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, what do you mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\\\r\\\\nhand that lay upon our visitor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knee. Five little livid spots, the\\\\r\\\\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have been cruelly used,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is a\\\\r\\\\nhard man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\\\\r\\\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is a very deep business,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a thousand\\\\r\\\\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\\\\r\\\\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\\\\r\\\\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\\\\r\\\\nwithout the knowledge of your step-father?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\\\\r\\\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\\\\r\\\\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper\\\\r\\\\nnow, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the\\\\r\\\\nway.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy no means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\\\\r\\\\ntown. But I shall return by the twelve o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock train, so as to be there\\\\r\\\\nin time for your coming.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\\\r\\\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided\\\\r\\\\nmy trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\\\\r\\\\nafternoon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\\\\r\\\\nfrom the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Sherlock Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nleaning back in his chair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDark enough and sinister enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\\\\r\\\\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\\\\r\\\\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\\\\r\\\\nend.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\\\r\\\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot think.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\\\\r\\\\nband of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\\\\r\\\\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\\\\r\\\\ninterest in preventing his step-daughter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marriage, the dying allusion\\\\r\\\\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\\\\r\\\\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\\\\r\\\\nwhich secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that\\\\r\\\\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\\\\r\\\\nthose lines.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what, then, did the gypsies do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see many objections to any such theory.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\\\\r\\\\nStoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\\\\r\\\\nor if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\\\r\\\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\\\r\\\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\\\r\\\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\\\\r\\\\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\\\\r\\\\nhis hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar\\\\r\\\\nof the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\\\\r\\\\nside. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\\\\r\\\\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\\\\r\\\\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\\\r\\\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\\\\r\\\\nof prey.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich of you is Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked this apparition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my companion,\\\\r\\\\nquietly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, blandly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take a seat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do nothing of the kind. My step-daughter has been here. I have\\\\r\\\\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat has she been saying to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d screamed the old man, furiously.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion, imperturbably.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! You put me off, do you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our new visitor, taking a step\\\\r\\\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know you, you scoundrel! I\\\\r\\\\nhave heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend smiled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes, the busybody!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis smile broadened.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour conversation is most entertaining,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\\\r\\\\ndraught.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will go when I have said my say. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare to meddle with my\\\\r\\\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\\\r\\\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He stepped swiftly forward,\\\\r\\\\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snarled, and hurling\\\\r\\\\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe seems a very amiable person,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am not\\\\r\\\\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\\\r\\\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As he spoke he picked up\\\\r\\\\nthe steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\\\r\\\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\\\\r\\\\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,\\\\r\\\\nwe shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\\\\r\\\\nmatter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was nearly one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\\\r\\\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\\\\r\\\\nwith notes and figures.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo determine\\\\r\\\\nits exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices\\\\r\\\\nof the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which\\\\r\\\\nat the time of the wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death was little short of \\\\xc2\\\\xa31100, is now,\\\\r\\\\nthrough the fall in agricultural prices, not more than \\\\xc2\\\\xa3750. Each\\\\r\\\\ndaughter can claim an income of \\\\xc2\\\\xa3250, in case of marriage. It is\\\\r\\\\nevident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would\\\\r\\\\nhave had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to\\\\r\\\\na very serious extent. My morning\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work has not been wasted, since it\\\\r\\\\nhas proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the\\\\r\\\\nway of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\\\\r\\\\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\\\\r\\\\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\\\\r\\\\ndrive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\\\r\\\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s No. 2 is an excellent argument\\\\r\\\\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\\\\r\\\\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\\\\r\\\\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five\\\\r\\\\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with\\\\r\\\\na bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\\\\r\\\\nway-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and\\\\r\\\\nthe air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at\\\\r\\\\nleast there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the\\\\r\\\\nspring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion\\\\r\\\\nsat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over\\\\r\\\\nhis eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest\\\\r\\\\nthought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and\\\\r\\\\npointed over the meadows.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\\\\r\\\\na grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\\\\r\\\\nthe gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStoke Moran?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked the\\\\r\\\\ndriver.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is some building going on there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat is where we\\\\r\\\\nare going.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the village,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\\\\r\\\\nsome distance to the left; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut if you want to get to the house, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\r\\\\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over\\\\r\\\\nthe fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Holmes, shading his\\\\r\\\\neyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\\\\r\\\\nLeatherhead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought it as well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat\\\\r\\\\nthis fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\\\\r\\\\ndefinite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.\\\\r\\\\nYou see that we have been as good as our word.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\\\\r\\\\nwhich spoke her joy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she\\\\r\\\\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll has turned out splendidly.\\\\r\\\\nDr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\\\\r\\\\nbefore evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have had the pleasure of making the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s acquaintance,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\\\r\\\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9che has followed me, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo it appears.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\\\\r\\\\nhe say when he returns?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more\\\\r\\\\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\\\\r\\\\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at\\\\r\\\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\\\\r\\\\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\\\\r\\\\nportion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out\\\\r\\\\non each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken, and\\\\r\\\\nblocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a\\\\r\\\\npicture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but\\\\r\\\\nthe right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\\\\r\\\\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\\\\r\\\\nthis was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\\\r\\\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\\\r\\\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\\\\r\\\\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep\\\\r\\\\nattention the outsides of the windows.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\\\r\\\\ncentre one to your sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and the one next to the main building to\\\\r\\\\nDr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chamber?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPending the alterations, as I understand. By-the-way, there does not\\\\r\\\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\\\r\\\\nroom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\\\\r\\\\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\\\\r\\\\nin it, of course?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any one to pass through.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\\\r\\\\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\\\\r\\\\nand bar your shutters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through\\\\r\\\\nthe open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,\\\\r\\\\nbut without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\\\\r\\\\npassed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\\\\r\\\\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHum!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy theory certainly\\\\r\\\\npresents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\\\\r\\\\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\\\\r\\\\nmatter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\\\\r\\\\nthree bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,\\\\r\\\\nso we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\\\\r\\\\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\\\\r\\\\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\\\\r\\\\nthe fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood\\\\r\\\\nin one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\\\\r\\\\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\\\\r\\\\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\\\r\\\\nroom, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards\\\\r\\\\nround and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so\\\\r\\\\nold and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of\\\\r\\\\nthe house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\\\\r\\\\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\\\r\\\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere does that bell communicate with?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, at last, pointing to\\\\r\\\\na thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\\\\r\\\\nlying upon the pillow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt goes to the house-keeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt looks newer than the other things?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\\\\r\\\\nwanted for ourselves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\\\\r\\\\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\\\\r\\\\nfloor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,\\\\r\\\\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\\\\r\\\\nbetween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\\\\r\\\\nthe chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent\\\\r\\\\nsome time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the\\\\r\\\\nwall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a dummy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it ring?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\\\\r\\\\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\\\\r\\\\nopening for the ventilator is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery strange!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are one or\\\\r\\\\ntwo very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\\\\r\\\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\\\\r\\\\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is also quite modern,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the lady.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94dummy\\\\r\\\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\\\\r\\\\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\\\\r\\\\ninner apartment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chamber was larger than that of his\\\\r\\\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\\\\r\\\\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair\\\\r\\\\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\\\\r\\\\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\\\\r\\\\nkeenest interest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, tapping the safe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy step-father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business papers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh! you have seen inside, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a cat in it, for example?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. What a strange idea!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, look at this!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\\\\r\\\\nthe top of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo; we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\\\\r\\\\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare\\\\r\\\\nsay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He squatted\\\\r\\\\ndown in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the\\\\r\\\\ngreatest attention.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. That is quite settled,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, rising and putting his\\\\r\\\\nlens in his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello! Here is something interesting!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one\\\\r\\\\ncorner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied\\\\r\\\\nso as to make a loop of whip-cord.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a common enough lash. But I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why it should be tied.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a wicked world,\\\\r\\\\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of\\\\r\\\\nall. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\\\\r\\\\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had never seen my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face so grim or his brow so dark as it\\\\r\\\\nwas when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\\\\r\\\\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\\\\r\\\\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\\\\r\\\\nreverie.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you should\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall most certainly do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\\\\r\\\\nupon your compliance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assure you that I am in your hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\\\r\\\\nroom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\\\\r\\\\ninn over there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, that is the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Crown.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\\\\r\\\\nwhen your step-father comes back. Then when you hear him retire for\\\\r\\\\nthe night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp,\\\\r\\\\nput your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\\\\r\\\\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\\\\r\\\\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\\\\r\\\\nthere for one night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, easily.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what will you do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\\\r\\\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleeve.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps I have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen for pity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\\\r\\\\ndied from some sudden fright.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\\\r\\\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.\\\\r\\\\nRoylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,\\\\r\\\\nand be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest\\\\r\\\\nassured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\\\\r\\\\nsitting-room at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrown Inn.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They were on the upper floor, and\\\\r\\\\nfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\\\\r\\\\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\\\\r\\\\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\\\\r\\\\nof the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\\\\r\\\\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nvoice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\\\\r\\\\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\\\\r\\\\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering\\\\r\\\\ndarkness, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\\\\r\\\\nis a distinct element of danger.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan I be of assistance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour presence might be invaluable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I shall certainly come.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very kind of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\\\r\\\\nwas visible to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\\\\r\\\\nyou saw all that I did.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\\\\r\\\\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou saw the ventilator, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have\\\\r\\\\na small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\\\\r\\\\nhardly pass through.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\\\r\\\\nMoran.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\\\r\\\\ncould smell Dr. Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\\\\r\\\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\\\\r\\\\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ninquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what harm can there be in that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\\\\r\\\\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\\\\r\\\\nnot that strike you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot as yet see any connection.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\\\r\\\\nbefore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot say that I have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\\\\r\\\\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for so we may call\\\\r\\\\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\\\\r\\\\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is\\\\r\\\\nthe first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\\\\r\\\\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\\\\r\\\\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\\\\r\\\\ndeeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\\\\r\\\\nover; for goodness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds\\\\r\\\\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAbout nine o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\\\r\\\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\\\\r\\\\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single\\\\r\\\\nbright light shone out right in front of us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is our signal,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit comes\\\\r\\\\nfrom the middle window.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\\\r\\\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\\\r\\\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\\\\r\\\\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\\\\r\\\\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\\\\r\\\\nsombre errand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\\\\r\\\\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees,\\\\r\\\\nwe reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\\\\r\\\\nwindow, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\\\\r\\\\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\\\\r\\\\nwith writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\\\\r\\\\ndarkness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I whispered; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdid you see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\\\r\\\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh, and put\\\\r\\\\nhis lips to my ear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a nice household,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is the baboon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was\\\\r\\\\na cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\\\\r\\\\nmoment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\\\\r\\\\nHolmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\\\\r\\\\nbedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\\\\r\\\\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\\\\r\\\\nseen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\\\\r\\\\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\\\\r\\\\nI could do to distinguish the words:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI nodded again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\\\r\\\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\\\\r\\\\nyou in that chair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\\\\r\\\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\\\\r\\\\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\\\\r\\\\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion\\\\r\\\\nsat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\\\\r\\\\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray\\\\r\\\\nof light, and we waited in absolute darkness. From outside came the\\\\r\\\\noccasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long\\\\r\\\\ndrawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at\\\\r\\\\nliberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,\\\\r\\\\nwhich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\\\r\\\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat\\\\r\\\\nwaiting silently for whatever might befall.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\\\\r\\\\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by\\\\r\\\\na strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some one in the next\\\\r\\\\nroom had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and\\\\r\\\\nthen all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half\\\\r\\\\nan hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\\\\r\\\\naudible\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\\\\r\\\\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\\\\r\\\\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\\\\r\\\\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see it, Watson?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he yelled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard\\\\r\\\\na low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\\\\r\\\\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\\\\r\\\\nso savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and\\\\r\\\\nfilled with horror and loathing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible\\\\r\\\\ncry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a\\\\r\\\\nhoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful\\\\r\\\\nshriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant\\\\r\\\\nparsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\\\r\\\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the\\\\r\\\\nlast echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can it mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I gasped.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt means that it is all over,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd perhaps, after\\\\r\\\\nall, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\\\r\\\\nRoylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\\\\r\\\\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.\\\\r\\\\nThen he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\\\\r\\\\npistol in my hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\\\\r\\\\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam\\\\r\\\\nof light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\\\\r\\\\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long\\\\r\\\\ngray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\\\\r\\\\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\\\\r\\\\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\\\\r\\\\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare\\\\r\\\\nat the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\\\\r\\\\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\\\\r\\\\nhis head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe band! the speckled band!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began\\\\r\\\\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\\\\r\\\\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a swamp adder!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe deadliest snake in India. He\\\\r\\\\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\\\\r\\\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\\\\r\\\\ndigs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and\\\\r\\\\nwe can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the\\\\r\\\\ncounty police know what has happened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap, and\\\\r\\\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck, he drew it from its horrid\\\\r\\\\nperch, and carrying it at arm\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\\\r\\\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\\\r\\\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\\\r\\\\nalready run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news\\\\r\\\\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\\\\r\\\\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\\\\r\\\\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\\\\r\\\\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\\\\r\\\\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\\\\r\\\\nback next day.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which\\\\r\\\\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\\\r\\\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the\\\\r\\\\nword \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98band,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the\\\\r\\\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\\\\r\\\\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\\\\r\\\\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\\\\r\\\\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened\\\\r\\\\nan occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the\\\\r\\\\ndoor. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to\\\\r\\\\nyou, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the\\\\r\\\\nbed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped\\\\r\\\\nto the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\\\r\\\\nthere as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming\\\\r\\\\nto the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when\\\\r\\\\nI coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a\\\\r\\\\nsupply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right\\\\r\\\\ntrack. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\\\\r\\\\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\\\\r\\\\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\\\\r\\\\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\\\\r\\\\nof view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\\\\r\\\\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\\\\r\\\\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\\\\r\\\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\\\\r\\\\nthe victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which\\\\r\\\\nwe saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\\\\r\\\\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\\\r\\\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\\\\r\\\\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\\\\r\\\\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.\\\\r\\\\nAn inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\\\\r\\\\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\\\\r\\\\nshould reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\\\\r\\\\nand the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts\\\\r\\\\nwhich may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\\\\r\\\\nobviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his\\\\r\\\\nsafe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know\\\\r\\\\nthe steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I\\\\r\\\\nheard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I\\\\r\\\\ninstantly lit the light and attacked it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\\\r\\\\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its\\\\r\\\\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this\\\\r\\\\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\\\\r\\\\nconscience.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure IX\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S THUMB\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr. Sherlock\\\\r\\\\nHolmes for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only\\\\r\\\\ntwo which I was the means of introducing to his notice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that of Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHatherley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s madness. Of these\\\\r\\\\nthe latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original\\\\r\\\\nobserver, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic\\\\r\\\\nin its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon\\\\r\\\\nrecord, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive\\\\r\\\\nmethods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The\\\\r\\\\nstory has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,\\\\r\\\\nlike all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set\\\\r\\\\nforth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts\\\\r\\\\nslowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually\\\\r\\\\naway as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the\\\\r\\\\ncomplete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression\\\\r\\\\nupon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the\\\\r\\\\neffect.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was in the summer of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9989, not long after my marriage, that the\\\\r\\\\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarize. I had returned to\\\\r\\\\ncivil practice, and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\\\\r\\\\nrooms, although I continually visited him, and occasionally even\\\\r\\\\npersuaded him to forego his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\\\\r\\\\nus. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at\\\\r\\\\nno very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients\\\\r\\\\nfrom among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful\\\\r\\\\nand lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues, and\\\\r\\\\nof endeavoring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\\\\r\\\\ninfluence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, I was awakened by\\\\r\\\\nthe maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come\\\\r\\\\nfrom Paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed\\\\r\\\\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\\\\r\\\\ntrivial, and hastened down-stairs. As I descended, my old ally, the\\\\r\\\\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got him here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9che\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\\\\r\\\\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a new patient,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bring him round\\\\r\\\\nmyself; then he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I\\\\r\\\\nmust go now, doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And off\\\\r\\\\nhe went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the\\\\r\\\\ntable. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft\\\\r\\\\ncloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his\\\\r\\\\nhands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with\\\\r\\\\nblood-stains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should\\\\r\\\\nsay, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and\\\\r\\\\ngave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong\\\\r\\\\nagitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I have\\\\r\\\\nhad a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\\\\r\\\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\\\\r\\\\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a\\\\r\\\\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI took it up and glanced at it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\\\r\\\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3d floor).\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d That was the name,\\\\r\\\\nstyle, and abode of my morning visitor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI regret that I have kept you\\\\r\\\\nwaiting,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are fresh\\\\r\\\\nfrom a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\\\\r\\\\noccupation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, and laughed. He\\\\r\\\\nlaughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his\\\\r\\\\nchair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against\\\\r\\\\nthat laugh.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpull yourself together!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and I poured out some\\\\r\\\\nwater from a caraffe.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\\\\r\\\\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\\\\r\\\\nover and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\\\\r\\\\nblushing hotly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been making a fool of myself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot at all. Drink this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\\\\r\\\\ncolor began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly\\\\r\\\\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my\\\\r\\\\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding\\\\r\\\\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\\\\r\\\\nbeen. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled\\\\r\\\\nconsiderably.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\\\r\\\\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was\\\\r\\\\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly\\\\r\\\\nround the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\\\r\\\\nprovince.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis has been done,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, examining the wound, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cby a very heavy and\\\\r\\\\nsharp instrument.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA thing like a cleaver,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn accident, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy no means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! a murderous attack?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery murderous indeed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou horrify me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\\\\r\\\\nover with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. He lay back without\\\\r\\\\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow is that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked, when I had finished.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\\\\r\\\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\\\\r\\\\nto your nerves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\\\r\\\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\\\\r\\\\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement; for\\\\r\\\\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\\\\r\\\\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clews which\\\\r\\\\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\\\\r\\\\nbe done.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\\\\r\\\\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\\\r\\\\nfriend Mr. Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered my visitor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I should\\\\r\\\\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\\\r\\\\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\\\\r\\\\nhim?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do better. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take you round to him myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be immensely obliged to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a\\\\r\\\\nlittle breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\\\r\\\\ninstant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I rushed up-stairs, explained the matter shortly to my\\\\r\\\\nwife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new\\\\r\\\\nacquaintance to Baker Street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in\\\\r\\\\nhis dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_, and smoking\\\\r\\\\nhis before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and\\\\r\\\\ndottels left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried\\\\r\\\\nand collected on the corner of the mantel-piece. He received us in his\\\\r\\\\nquietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us\\\\r\\\\nin a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\\\r\\\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\\\\r\\\\nbrandy-and-water within his reach.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHatherley,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely\\\\r\\\\nat home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up\\\\r\\\\nyour strength with a little stimulant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my patient, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I have felt another man since the\\\\r\\\\ndoctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\\\\r\\\\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\\\\r\\\\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes sat in his big arm-chair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\\\r\\\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,\\\\r\\\\nand we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\\\\r\\\\ndetailed to us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\\\r\\\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am an hydraulic engineer,\\\\r\\\\nand I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\\\\r\\\\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known\\\\r\\\\nfirm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having\\\\r\\\\nalso come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s death,\\\\r\\\\nI determined to start in business for myself, and took professional\\\\r\\\\nchambers in Victoria Street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose that every one finds his first independent start in business\\\\r\\\\na dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two\\\\r\\\\nyears I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings\\\\r\\\\namount to \\\\xc2\\\\xa327 10_s._ Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\\\\r\\\\nthe afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began\\\\r\\\\nto sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at\\\\r\\\\nall.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office,\\\\r\\\\nmy clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to\\\\r\\\\nsee me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Colonel Lysander Stark\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the\\\\r\\\\ncolonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding\\\\r\\\\nthinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole\\\\r\\\\nface sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks\\\\r\\\\nwas drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation\\\\r\\\\nseemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\\\\r\\\\nbright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but\\\\r\\\\nneatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\\\\r\\\\nthirty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr. Hatherley?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, with something of a German accent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You\\\\r\\\\nhave been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not\\\\r\\\\nonly proficient in his profession, but is also discreet and capable of\\\\r\\\\npreserving a secret.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\\\\r\\\\naddress. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at\\\\r\\\\nthis moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\\\\r\\\\nand a bachelor, and are residing alone in London.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That is quite correct,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but you will excuse me if\\\\r\\\\nI say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\\\\r\\\\nqualifications. I understood that it was on a professional matter that\\\\r\\\\nyou wished to speak to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the\\\\r\\\\npoint. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy\\\\r\\\\nis quite essential\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94_absolute_ secrecy, you understand, and of course\\\\r\\\\nwe may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives\\\\r\\\\nin the bosom of his family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98If I promise to keep a secret,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you may absolutely depend\\\\r\\\\nupon my doing so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\\\\r\\\\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Do you promise, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, at last.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, I promise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference\\\\r\\\\nto the matter at all, either in word or writing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have already given you my word.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across\\\\r\\\\nthe room, he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, coming back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I know that clerks are\\\\r\\\\nsometimes curious as to their master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s affairs. Now we can talk in\\\\r\\\\nsafety.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He drew up his chair very close to mine, and began to stare at\\\\r\\\\nme again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to\\\\r\\\\nrise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even\\\\r\\\\nmy dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my\\\\r\\\\nimpatience.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I beg that you will state your business, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98my time is of\\\\r\\\\nvalue.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to\\\\r\\\\nmy lips.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98How would fifty guineas for a night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work suit you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Most admirably.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I say a night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work, but an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s would be nearer the mark. I\\\\r\\\\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has\\\\r\\\\ngot out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\\\\r\\\\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of\\\\r\\\\nOxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from\\\\r\\\\nPaddington which would bring you there at about 11.15.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There is a drive, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven\\\\r\\\\nmiles from Eyford Station.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would\\\\r\\\\nbe no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense\\\\r\\\\nyou for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\\\\r\\\\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of\\\\r\\\\nyour profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of\\\\r\\\\nthe business, there is plenty of time to do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be\\\\r\\\\nto me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Not at all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall be very happy to accommodate\\\\r\\\\nmyself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little\\\\r\\\\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have\\\\r\\\\nexacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to\\\\r\\\\ncommit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\\\\r\\\\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Entirely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\\\r\\\\nfuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one\\\\r\\\\nor two places in England?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have heard so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Some little time ago I bought a small place\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a very small\\\\r\\\\nplace\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover\\\\r\\\\nthat there was a deposit of fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth in one of my fields. On\\\\r\\\\nexamining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively\\\\r\\\\nsmall one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones\\\\r\\\\nupon the right and left\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94both of them, however, in the grounds of my\\\\r\\\\nneighbors. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land\\\\r\\\\ncontained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally,\\\\r\\\\nit was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true\\\\r\\\\nvalue; but, unfortunately, I had no capital by which I could do this. I\\\\r\\\\ntook a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested\\\\r\\\\nthat we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and\\\\r\\\\nthat in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy\\\\r\\\\nthe neighboring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and\\\\r\\\\nin order to help us in our operations we erected an hydraulic press.\\\\r\\\\nThis press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we\\\\r\\\\nwish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers\\\\r\\\\ncoming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if\\\\r\\\\nthe facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\\\\r\\\\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise\\\\r\\\\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford\\\\r\\\\nto-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I quite follow you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The only point which I could not\\\\r\\\\nquite understand, was what use you could make of an hydraulic press\\\\r\\\\nin excavating fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like\\\\r\\\\ngravel from a pit.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, carelessly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we have our own process. We compress\\\\r\\\\nthe earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what\\\\r\\\\nthey are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my\\\\r\\\\nconfidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nHe rose as he spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11.15.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall certainly be there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And not a word to a soul.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He looked at me with a last, long,\\\\r\\\\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he\\\\r\\\\nhurried from the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\\\r\\\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\\\r\\\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the\\\\r\\\\nfee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\\\\r\\\\nupon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead\\\\r\\\\nto other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron\\\\r\\\\nhad made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that\\\\r\\\\nhis explanation of the fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth was sufficient to explain the\\\\r\\\\nnecessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\\\\r\\\\nshould tell any one of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\\\\r\\\\nwinds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\\\\r\\\\nhaving obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98NOT A WORD TO A SOUL\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage, but my station.\\\\r\\\\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\\\\r\\\\nlittle dim-lit station after eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. I was the only passenger\\\\r\\\\nwho got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\\\\r\\\\nsleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\\\\r\\\\nupon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\\\\r\\\\ninto a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the\\\\r\\\\nwindows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\\\\r\\\\nfast as the horse could go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne horse?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d interjected Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, only one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you observe the color?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\\\\r\\\\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTired-looking or fresh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, fresh and glossy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\\\r\\\\ninteresting statement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\\\r\\\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\\\\r\\\\nthe rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that\\\\r\\\\nit must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\\\\r\\\\ntime, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\\\\r\\\\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\\\\r\\\\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\\\\r\\\\njolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\\\\r\\\\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\\\\r\\\\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\\\\r\\\\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey,\\\\r\\\\nbut the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation\\\\r\\\\nsoon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged\\\\r\\\\nfor the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to\\\\r\\\\na stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after\\\\r\\\\nhim, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We\\\\r\\\\nstepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so\\\\r\\\\nthat I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the\\\\r\\\\nhouse. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\\\\r\\\\nheavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the\\\\r\\\\ncarriage drove away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\\\r\\\\nlooking for matches, and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\\\\r\\\\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\\\\r\\\\nshot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with\\\\r\\\\na lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\\\\r\\\\nforward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\\\\r\\\\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that\\\\r\\\\nit was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\\\\r\\\\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\\\\r\\\\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\\\\r\\\\nher hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\\\\r\\\\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\\\r\\\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\\\r\\\\nminutes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\\\\r\\\\nplainly-furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\\\r\\\\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\\\\r\\\\non the top of a harmonium beside the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall not keep you\\\\r\\\\nwaiting an instant,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance\\\\r\\\\nof German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\\\\r\\\\nothers being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\\\\r\\\\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\\\\r\\\\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\\\\r\\\\nsilent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\\\\r\\\\npassage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\\\\r\\\\nuneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\\\\r\\\\nwhat were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?\\\\r\\\\nAnd where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was\\\\r\\\\nall I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.\\\\r\\\\nFor that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within\\\\r\\\\nthat radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it\\\\r\\\\nwas quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\\\r\\\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\\\\r\\\\nto keep up my spirits, and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\\\\r\\\\nfifty-guinea fee.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\\\\r\\\\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\\\\r\\\\nstanding in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\\\\r\\\\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\\\\r\\\\ncould see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\\\\r\\\\nchill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\\\\r\\\\nsilent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\\\\r\\\\neyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\\\\r\\\\nbehind her.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I would go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\\\\r\\\\ncalmly; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\\\\r\\\\nto do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But, madam,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\\\\r\\\\npossibly leave until I have seen the machine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is not worth your while to wait,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You can pass\\\\r\\\\nthrough the door; no one hinders.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 And then, seeing that I smiled and\\\\r\\\\nshook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\\\\r\\\\nforward, with her hands wrung together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98For the love of Heaven!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she\\\\r\\\\nwhispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98get away from here before it is too late!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\\\\r\\\\nin an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\\\\r\\\\nfifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\\\\r\\\\nwhich seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\\\\r\\\\nI slink away without having carried out my commission, and without\\\\r\\\\nthe payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\\\\r\\\\nmonomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\\\\r\\\\nshaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head, and\\\\r\\\\ndeclared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\\\\r\\\\nher entreaties, when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\\\\r\\\\nfootsteps were heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,\\\\r\\\\nthrew up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly\\\\r\\\\nand as noiselessly as she had come.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe new-comers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short, thick man with\\\\r\\\\na chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who\\\\r\\\\nwas introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is my secretary and manager,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said the colonel. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98By-the-way, I\\\\r\\\\nwas under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear\\\\r\\\\nthat you have felt the draught.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98On the contrary,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I opened the door myself, because I felt\\\\r\\\\nthe room to be a little close.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Perhaps we had better\\\\r\\\\nproceed to business, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr. Ferguson and I will take you\\\\r\\\\nup to see the machine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh no, it is in the house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What, you dig fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth in the house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All\\\\r\\\\nwe wish you to do is to examine the machine, and to let us know what is\\\\r\\\\nwrong with it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe went up-stairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\\\\r\\\\nmanager, and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\\\\r\\\\ncorridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\\\\r\\\\nthe thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\\\\r\\\\ncrossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture\\\\r\\\\nabove the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls,\\\\r\\\\nand the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried\\\\r\\\\nto put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten\\\\r\\\\nthe warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a\\\\r\\\\nkeen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and\\\\r\\\\nsilent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at\\\\r\\\\nleast a fellow-countryman.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\\\r\\\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\\\\r\\\\ncould hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\\\\r\\\\ncolonel ushered me in.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98We are now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98actually within the hydraulic press, and it\\\\r\\\\nwould be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if any one were to\\\\r\\\\nturn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\\\\r\\\\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\\\\r\\\\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\\\\r\\\\nwhich receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\\\\r\\\\nmanner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\\\\r\\\\nthere is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\\\\r\\\\nof its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\\\\r\\\\nshow us how we can set it right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\\\\r\\\\nIt was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\\\\r\\\\npressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\\\\r\\\\nwhich controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\\\\r\\\\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\\\\r\\\\none of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\\\\r\\\\nindia-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\\\\r\\\\nso as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\\\\r\\\\nclearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\\\\r\\\\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several\\\\r\\\\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\\\\r\\\\nI had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\\\\r\\\\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\\\\r\\\\nobvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth was the merest\\\\r\\\\nfabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\\\r\\\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\\\r\\\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\\\\r\\\\nto examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\\\\r\\\\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when I\\\\r\\\\nheard a muttered exclamation in German, and saw the cadaverous face of\\\\r\\\\nthe colonel looking down at me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What are you doing there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\\\\r\\\\nwhich he had told me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I was admiring your fuller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-earth,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\r\\\\nthink that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\\\\r\\\\nI knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\\\\r\\\\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray\\\\r\\\\neyes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Very well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you shall know all about the machine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He took\\\\r\\\\na step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\\\\r\\\\nlock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\\\\r\\\\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hello!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nI yelled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hello! Colonel! Let me out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\\\\r\\\\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\\\\r\\\\nleaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\\\\r\\\\nupon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\\\\r\\\\nlight I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\\\\r\\\\njerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which\\\\r\\\\nmust within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\\\\r\\\\nscreaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\\\\r\\\\nimplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\\\\r\\\\nlevers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\\\\r\\\\nhead, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\\\r\\\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\\\\r\\\\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face\\\\r\\\\nthe weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\\\\r\\\\ndreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\\\\r\\\\nto lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\\\\r\\\\nAlready I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\\\\r\\\\nbrought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\\\\r\\\\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin\\\\r\\\\nline of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\\\\r\\\\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\\\\r\\\\nhardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\\\\r\\\\nThe next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\\\\r\\\\nother side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\\\\r\\\\nlamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\\\\r\\\\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\\\\r\\\\nfound myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\\\\r\\\\nwoman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\\\\r\\\\na candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\\\\r\\\\nso foolishly rejected.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Come! come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she cried, breathlessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98They will be here in a moment.\\\\r\\\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\\\\r\\\\ntime, but come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\\\\r\\\\nfeet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\\\\r\\\\nlatter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we\\\\r\\\\nheard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one\\\\r\\\\nanswering the other, from the floor on which we were and from the one\\\\r\\\\nbeneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her\\\\r\\\\nwits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through\\\\r\\\\nthe window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is your only chance,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is high, but it may be that\\\\r\\\\nyou can jump it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\\\\r\\\\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\\\\r\\\\nforward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ncleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\\\\r\\\\nwindow, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\\\\r\\\\nlooked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\\\\r\\\\ndown. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\\\\r\\\\nshould have heard what passed between my savior and the ruffian who\\\\r\\\\npursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\\\\r\\\\ngo back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\\\\r\\\\nmind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\\\\r\\\\nher arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Fritz! Fritz!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she cried, in English, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98remember your promise after\\\\r\\\\nthe last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,\\\\r\\\\nhe will be silent!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You are mad, Elise!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nHe dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\\\\r\\\\nhis heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\\\\r\\\\nthe sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\\\\r\\\\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\\\\r\\\\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\\\\r\\\\nthat I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\\\\r\\\\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at\\\\r\\\\nmy hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time,\\\\r\\\\nsaw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from\\\\r\\\\nmy wound. I endeavored to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came\\\\r\\\\na sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint\\\\r\\\\namong the rose-bushes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been\\\\r\\\\na very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\\\\r\\\\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\\\\r\\\\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.\\\\r\\\\nThe smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my\\\\r\\\\nnight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I\\\\r\\\\nmight hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But, to my astonishment,\\\\r\\\\nwhen I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.\\\\r\\\\nI had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road, and\\\\r\\\\njust a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my\\\\r\\\\napproaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the\\\\r\\\\nprevious night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that\\\\r\\\\nhad passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\\\r\\\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter\\\\r\\\\nwas on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of\\\\r\\\\nhim whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\\\r\\\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\\\\r\\\\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\\\\r\\\\none about three miles off.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\\\\r\\\\nwait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\\\\r\\\\nwas a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\\\\r\\\\ndressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\\\\r\\\\nput the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after, listening to this\\\\r\\\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\\\\r\\\\nshelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\\\\r\\\\ncuttings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\r\\\\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Lost,\\\\r\\\\non the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, an hydraulic\\\\r\\\\nengineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock at night, and has not been\\\\r\\\\nheard of since. Was dressed in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\\\\r\\\\nlast time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\\\r\\\\nfancy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried my patient. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen that explains what the girl\\\\r\\\\nsaid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\\\\r\\\\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\\\\r\\\\nin the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\\\\r\\\\nleave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\\\\r\\\\nprecious, so if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to Scotland Yard\\\\r\\\\nat once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\\\\r\\\\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\\\\r\\\\na plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance\\\\r\\\\nmap of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses\\\\r\\\\ndrawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere you are,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten\\\\r\\\\nmiles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\\\\r\\\\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s good drive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\\\\r\\\\nunconscious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\\\r\\\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat I cannot understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis why they should have spared you\\\\r\\\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\\\\r\\\\nwas softened by the woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s entreaties.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\\\\r\\\\nlife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Bradstreet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have\\\\r\\\\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\\\\r\\\\nthat we are in search of are to be found.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I could lay my finger on it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, quietly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally, now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the inspector, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have formed your opinion!\\\\r\\\\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\\\\r\\\\ncountry is more deserted there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I say east,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my patient.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am for west,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked the plain-clothes man. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are several\\\\r\\\\nquiet little villages up there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I am for north,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause there are no hills there, and\\\\r\\\\nour friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the inspector, laughing; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a very pretty diversity\\\\r\\\\nof opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\\\\r\\\\ncasting vote to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are all wrong.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t _all_ be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, you can. This is my point;\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he placed his finger in the centre\\\\r\\\\nof the circle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is where we shall find them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the twelve-mile drive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped Hatherley.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\\\\r\\\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\\\\r\\\\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d observed Bradstreet,\\\\r\\\\nthoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this\\\\r\\\\ngang.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone at all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are coiners on a large scale, and\\\\r\\\\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\\\\r\\\\nsilver.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\r\\\\ninspector. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We\\\\r\\\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\\\\r\\\\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\\\\r\\\\nhands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\\\\r\\\\nthem right enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\\\\r\\\\nto fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\\\\r\\\\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\\\\r\\\\nclump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich\\\\r\\\\nfeather over the landscape.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA house on fire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on\\\\r\\\\nits way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the station-master.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen did it break out?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\\\\r\\\\nthe whole place is in a blaze.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhose house is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDr. Becher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTell me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d broke in the engineer, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\\\\r\\\\nwith a long, sharp nose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\\\r\\\\nEnglishman, and there isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\\\r\\\\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as\\\\r\\\\nI understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\\\\r\\\\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\\\\r\\\\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill,\\\\r\\\\nand there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us,\\\\r\\\\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\\\\r\\\\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is the\\\\r\\\\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\\\\r\\\\nwindow is the one that I jumped from.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, at least,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have had your revenge upon them.\\\\r\\\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\\\r\\\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\\\\r\\\\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\\\\r\\\\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\\\\r\\\\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no\\\\r\\\\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\\\\r\\\\nGerman, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\\\\r\\\\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\\\\r\\\\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\\\\r\\\\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ingenuity failed ever to\\\\r\\\\ndiscover the least clew as to their whereabouts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\\\r\\\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\\\r\\\\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\\\\r\\\\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\\\\r\\\\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\\\\r\\\\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\\\\r\\\\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\\\\r\\\\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\\\\r\\\\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\\\r\\\\nbeen already referred to.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\\\\r\\\\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\\\\r\\\\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\\\\r\\\\ntale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\\\\r\\\\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\\\\r\\\\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\\\\r\\\\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\\\\r\\\\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once\\\\r\\\\nmore to London, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\\\\r\\\\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExperience,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndirectly it may be of value,\\\\r\\\\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\\\r\\\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure X\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\\\\r\\\\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\\\\r\\\\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it,\\\\r\\\\nand their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\\\\r\\\\nfour-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the\\\\r\\\\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\\\\r\\\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\\\\r\\\\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\\\r\\\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\\\r\\\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\\\\r\\\\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.\\\\r\\\\nI had remained in-doors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden\\\\r\\\\nturn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I\\\\r\\\\nhad brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign,\\\\r\\\\nthrobbed with dull persistency. With my body in one easy-chair and my\\\\r\\\\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers,\\\\r\\\\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\\\r\\\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\\\r\\\\nenvelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s noble\\\\r\\\\ncorrespondent could be.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked, as he entered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour\\\\r\\\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\\\r\\\\ntide-waiter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nanswered, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\\\r\\\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\\\\r\\\\na man either to be bored or to lie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot social, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, distinctly professional.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd from a noble client?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of the highest in England.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\\\\r\\\\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\\\\r\\\\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\\\\r\\\\nnew investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\\\\r\\\\nhave you not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt looks like it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\\\\r\\\\ncorner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have had nothing else to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\\\r\\\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is\\\\r\\\\nalways instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\\\\r\\\\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, with the deepest interest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\\\\r\\\\nSimon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these\\\\r\\\\npapers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he\\\\r\\\\nsays:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Lord Backwater tells me that I\\\\r\\\\n  may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.\\\\r\\\\n  I have determined, therefore, to call upon you, and to consult\\\\r\\\\n  you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred\\\\r\\\\n  in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,\\\\r\\\\n  is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees\\\\r\\\\n  no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that\\\\r\\\\n  it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in\\\\r\\\\n  the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at\\\\r\\\\n  that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is\\\\r\\\\n  of paramount importance.    Yours faithfully,   ST. SIMON.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\\\r\\\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer\\\\r\\\\nside of his right little finger,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, as he folded up the\\\\r\\\\nepistle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe says four o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\\\r\\\\nsubject. Turn over those papers, and arrange the extracts in their\\\\r\\\\norder of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He\\\\r\\\\npicked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside\\\\r\\\\nthe mantel-piece. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere he is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, sitting down and flattening it\\\\r\\\\nout upon his knee. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second\\\\r\\\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Hum! Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief\\\\r\\\\nover a fess sable. Born in 1846. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forty-one years of age, which\\\\r\\\\nis mature for marriage. Was Undersecretary for the Colonies in a late\\\\r\\\\nAdministration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\\\r\\\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and\\\\r\\\\nTudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive\\\\r\\\\nin all this. I think that I must turn to you, Watson, for something\\\\r\\\\nmore solid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor\\\\r\\\\nthe facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\\\r\\\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry\\\\r\\\\non hand, and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture\\\\r\\\\nvan. That is quite cleared up now\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94though, indeed, it was obvious from\\\\r\\\\nthe first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\\\\r\\\\ncolumn of _The Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A marriage has been arranged,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it says, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and will, if rumor is\\\\r\\\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second\\\\r\\\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of\\\\r\\\\nAloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 That is all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTerse and to the point,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin\\\\r\\\\nlegs towards the fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers\\\\r\\\\nof the same week. Ah, here it is. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There will soon be a call for\\\\r\\\\nprotection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle\\\\r\\\\nappears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the\\\\r\\\\nmanagement of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the\\\\r\\\\nhands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important\\\\r\\\\naddition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes\\\\r\\\\nwhich have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\\\\r\\\\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\\\r\\\\ngod\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\\\\r\\\\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\\\r\\\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\\\\r\\\\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an\\\\r\\\\nonly child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\\\\r\\\\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.\\\\r\\\\nAs it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled\\\\r\\\\nto sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon\\\\r\\\\nhas no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmoor, it\\\\r\\\\nis obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\\\\r\\\\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\\\\r\\\\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnything else?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, yawning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes; plenty. Then there is another note in _The Morning Post_ to\\\\r\\\\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\\\\r\\\\nbe at St. George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\\\\r\\\\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\\\\r\\\\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\\\\r\\\\nDoran. Two days later\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is, on Wednesday last\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94there is a curt\\\\r\\\\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honey-moon\\\\r\\\\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place, near Petersfield. Those are\\\\r\\\\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBefore the what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, with a start.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe vanishing of the lady.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen did she vanish, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt the wedding breakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\\\r\\\\ndramatic, in fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\\\r\\\\nhoney-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\\\\r\\\\nPray let me have the details.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps we may make them less so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\\\r\\\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Singular\\\\r\\\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the\\\\r\\\\ngreatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have\\\\r\\\\ntaken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\\\\r\\\\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\\\\r\\\\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\\\\r\\\\nrumors which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of\\\\r\\\\nthe attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public\\\\r\\\\nattention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served\\\\r\\\\nby affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, Hanover Square,\\\\r\\\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\\\\r\\\\nbride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\\\\r\\\\nLord Eustace, and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister\\\\r\\\\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party\\\\r\\\\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\\\\r\\\\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little\\\\r\\\\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained,\\\\r\\\\nwho endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\\\\r\\\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after\\\\r\\\\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\\\r\\\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\\\\r\\\\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\\\\r\\\\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room.\\\\r\\\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\\\\r\\\\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\\\\r\\\\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to\\\\r\\\\nthe passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave\\\\r\\\\nthe house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\\\\r\\\\nmistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that\\\\r\\\\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\\\r\\\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with\\\\r\\\\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\\\\r\\\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\\\\r\\\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to\\\\r\\\\nthe whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumors of foul play in\\\\r\\\\nthe matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of\\\\r\\\\nthe woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that,\\\\r\\\\nfrom jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\\\\r\\\\nstrange disappearance of the bride.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd is that all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\\\r\\\\nsuggestive one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it is\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\\\r\\\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\\\\r\\\\nat the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Allegro,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\\\r\\\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\\\\r\\\\nnow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\\\r\\\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\\\\r\\\\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\\\\r\\\\nwill prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\\\\r\\\\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord Robert St. Simon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\\\r\\\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\\\\r\\\\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and\\\\r\\\\nwith the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had\\\\r\\\\never been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet\\\\r\\\\nhis general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a\\\\r\\\\nslight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His\\\\r\\\\nhair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled\\\\r\\\\nround the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful\\\\r\\\\nto the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\\\r\\\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored\\\\r\\\\ngaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\\\\r\\\\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\\\\r\\\\neye-glasses.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take\\\\r\\\\nthe basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up\\\\r\\\\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have\\\\r\\\\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\\\\r\\\\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I am descending.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI beg pardon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy last client of the sort was a king.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe King of Scandinavia.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, suavely, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat I extend to the\\\\r\\\\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\\\r\\\\nyours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course! Very right! very right! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\\\r\\\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\\\r\\\\nforming an opinion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\\\r\\\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94this article,\\\\r\\\\nfor example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before any one could offer\\\\r\\\\nan opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\\\\r\\\\nquestioning you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou were travelling in the States?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you become engaged then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you were on a friendly footing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHer father is very rich?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how did he make his money?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\\\\r\\\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94your wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ncharacter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\\\\r\\\\nfire. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmy wife was twenty before her\\\\r\\\\nfather became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining\\\\r\\\\ncamp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education\\\\r\\\\nhas come from Nature rather than from the school-master. She is what\\\\r\\\\nwe call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free,\\\\r\\\\nunfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94volcanic, I\\\\r\\\\nwas about to say. She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless\\\\r\\\\nin carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have\\\\r\\\\ngiven her the name which I have the honor to bear\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he gave a little\\\\r\\\\nstately cough\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chad not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I\\\\r\\\\nbelieve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything\\\\r\\\\ndishonorable would be repugnant to her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you her photograph?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI brought this with me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened a locket, and showed us the full\\\\r\\\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph, but an ivory\\\\r\\\\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\\\\r\\\\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and\\\\r\\\\nhanded it back to Lord St. Simon.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\\\r\\\\nacquaintance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met\\\\r\\\\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\\\\r\\\\naccompli_?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\\\r\\\\nwedding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas she in good spirits?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\\\r\\\\nlives.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was as bright as possible\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94at least, until after the ceremony.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\\\\r\\\\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident, however,\\\\r\\\\nwas too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the\\\\r\\\\ncase.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray let us have it, for all that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\\\r\\\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\\\\r\\\\ninto the pew. There was a moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s delay, but the gentleman in the\\\\r\\\\npew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse\\\\r\\\\nfor the fall. Yet, when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\\\\r\\\\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\\\\r\\\\nagitated over this trifling cause.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\\\r\\\\ngeneral public were present, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\\\r\\\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I\\\\r\\\\nthink that we are wandering rather far from the point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\\\\r\\\\nframe of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering\\\\r\\\\nher father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd who is her maid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlice is her name. She is an American, and came from California with\\\\r\\\\nher.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA confidential servant?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\\\r\\\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these\\\\r\\\\nthings in a different way.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did not overhear what they said?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLady St. Simon said something about \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98jumping a claim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 She was\\\\r\\\\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\\\r\\\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn your arm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.\\\\r\\\\nThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\\\\r\\\\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\\\r\\\\nroom, covered her bride\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\\\\r\\\\nand went out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\\\r\\\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\\\r\\\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house that morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and\\\\r\\\\nyour relations to her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\r\\\\nhave been on a friendly footing for some years\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I may say on a _very_\\\\r\\\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Allegro.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I have not treated\\\\r\\\\nher ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me;\\\\r\\\\nbut you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing,\\\\r\\\\nbut exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\\\\r\\\\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married; and, to\\\\r\\\\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\\\\r\\\\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\\\\r\\\\nto Mr. Doran\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push\\\\r\\\\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\\\\r\\\\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\\\\r\\\\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\\\\r\\\\npushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\\\\r\\\\nin making a row.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid your wife hear all this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\\\r\\\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some\\\\r\\\\nterrible trap for her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it is a possible supposition.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou think so, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this\\\\r\\\\nas likely?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\\\r\\\\nyour own theory as to what took place?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have\\\\r\\\\ngiven you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\\\\r\\\\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\\\\r\\\\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\\\\r\\\\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I will\\\\r\\\\nnot say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\\\r\\\\nsuccess\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nsmiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\\\\r\\\\ndata. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\\\\r\\\\nyou could see out of the window?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I\\\\r\\\\nshall communicate with you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said our\\\\r\\\\nclient, rising.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have solved it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEh? What was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say that I have solved it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere, then, is my wife?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that it will take wiser\\\\r\\\\nheads than yours or mine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\\\r\\\\nold-fashioned manner, he departed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honor my head by putting it\\\\r\\\\non a level with his own,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think\\\\r\\\\nthat I shall have a whiskey-and-soda and a cigar after all this\\\\r\\\\ncross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\\\\r\\\\nour client came into the room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Holmes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\\\r\\\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to\\\\r\\\\nturn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is\\\\r\\\\noccasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to\\\\r\\\\nquote Thoreau\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s example.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\\\\r\\\\nso well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back,\\\\r\\\\nand something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\\\\r\\\\nFranco-Prussian war. It is one of these cases\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but, hello, here is\\\\r\\\\nLestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon\\\\r\\\\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\\\\r\\\\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\\\\r\\\\nbag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\\\\r\\\\ncigar which had been offered to him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou look\\\\r\\\\ndissatisfied.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.\\\\r\\\\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally! You surprise me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clew seems to slip\\\\r\\\\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laying his hand\\\\r\\\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn Heaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name, what for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy? What do you mean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\\\r\\\\nas in the other.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you know all\\\\r\\\\nabout it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snarled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\\\r\\\\nmatter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think it very unlikely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this\\\\r\\\\nin it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\\\r\\\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes, and a\\\\r\\\\nbride\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wreath and veil, all discolored and soaked in water. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is\\\\r\\\\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, indeed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\r\\\\ndragged them from the Serpentine?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They\\\\r\\\\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\\\\r\\\\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body is to be found in\\\\r\\\\nthe neighborhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive\\\\r\\\\nat through this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you, indeed, now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Lestrade, with some bitterness. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am\\\\r\\\\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\\\\r\\\\nand your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\\\r\\\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\\\\r\\\\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He slapped it down\\\\r\\\\nupon the table in front of him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen to this: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You will see me when\\\\r\\\\nall is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Now my theory all along has been\\\\r\\\\nthat Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\\\\r\\\\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\\\\r\\\\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\\\\r\\\\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within\\\\r\\\\ntheir reach.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good, Lestrade,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, laughing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou really are very fine\\\\r\\\\nindeed. Let me see it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took up the paper in a listless way, but\\\\r\\\\nhis attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\\\r\\\\nsatisfaction. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is indeed important,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! you find it so?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nshrieked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re looking at the wrong side!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe right side? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over\\\\r\\\\nhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\\\\r\\\\nwhich interests me deeply.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oct.\\\\r\\\\n4th, rooms 8_s._, breakfast 2_s._ 6_d._, cocktail 1_s._, lunch 2_s._\\\\r\\\\n6_d._, glass sherry, 8_d._\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I see nothing in that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,\\\\r\\\\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\\\\r\\\\nyou again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve wasted time enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lestrade, rising. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe in hard\\\\r\\\\nwork, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\\\r\\\\nfirst.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\\\r\\\\nfor the door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d drawled Holmes, before his rival\\\\r\\\\nvanished; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\\\r\\\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\\\r\\\\nperson.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped\\\\r\\\\nhis forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose and put on his\\\\r\\\\novercoat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is something in what the fellow says about out-door\\\\r\\\\nwork,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\\\\r\\\\npapers for a little.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was after five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\\\\r\\\\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nman with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a\\\\r\\\\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\\\\r\\\\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\\\\r\\\\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\\\\r\\\\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _p\\\\xc3\\\\xa2t\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 de foie gras_ pie, with a group of\\\\r\\\\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\\\\r\\\\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\\\\r\\\\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\\\\r\\\\nto this address.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJust before nine o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\\\r\\\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\\\\r\\\\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have laid the supper, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, rubbing his hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am\\\\r\\\\nsurprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that\\\\r\\\\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling\\\\r\\\\nhis glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed\\\\r\\\\nexpression upon his aristocratic features.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy messenger reached you, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\\\r\\\\nyou good authority for what you say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe best possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat will the duke say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhen he hears that one of the\\\\r\\\\nfamily has been subjected to such humiliation?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\\\r\\\\nhumiliation.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, you look on these things from another stand-point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fail to see that any one is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\\\r\\\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\\\r\\\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise\\\\r\\\\nher at such a crisis.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lord St. Simon, tapping\\\\r\\\\nhis fingers upon the table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented\\\\r\\\\na position.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\\\r\\\\nshamefully used.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I heard a ring,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, there are steps on\\\\r\\\\nthe landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\\\r\\\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\\\r\\\\nsuccessful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLord St. Simon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nFrancis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt the sight of these new-comers our client had sprung from his seat\\\\r\\\\nand stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into\\\\r\\\\nthe breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady\\\\r\\\\nhad taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but\\\\r\\\\nhe still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\\\\r\\\\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re angry, Robert,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I guess you have every cause\\\\r\\\\nto be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray make no apology to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Lord St. Simon, bitterly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I know that I have treated you real bad, and that I should\\\\r\\\\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\\\\r\\\\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what I was\\\\r\\\\ndoing or saying. I only wonder I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fall down and do a faint right\\\\r\\\\nthere before the altar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\\\\r\\\\nroom while you explain this matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I may give an opinion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked the strange gentleman, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had\\\\r\\\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\\\\r\\\\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was\\\\r\\\\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean shaven, with a sharp face and alert\\\\r\\\\nmanner.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell our story right away,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the lady. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrank here and I\\\\r\\\\nmet in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9984, in McQuire\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working\\\\r\\\\na claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\\\\r\\\\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\\\\r\\\\na claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew, the\\\\r\\\\npoorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear of our engagement lasting\\\\r\\\\nany longer, and he took me away to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco. Frank wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t throw up\\\\r\\\\nhis hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa\\\\r\\\\nknowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so\\\\r\\\\nwe just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and\\\\r\\\\nmake his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as\\\\r\\\\nmuch as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and\\\\r\\\\npledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\r\\\\nwe be married right away, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and then I will feel sure of\\\\r\\\\nyou; and I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t claim to be your husband until I come back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Well, we\\\\r\\\\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\\\\r\\\\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\\\\r\\\\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\\\r\\\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\\\r\\\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 camp had been\\\\r\\\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name among the\\\\r\\\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\\\\r\\\\nthought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco.\\\\r\\\\nNot a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted\\\\r\\\\nthat Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco, and we\\\\r\\\\ncame to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased,\\\\r\\\\nbut I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the\\\\r\\\\nplace in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have done my\\\\r\\\\nduty by him. We can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\\\\r\\\\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\\\\r\\\\nwife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\\\\r\\\\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing\\\\r\\\\nand looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\\\\r\\\\nfirst; but when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of\\\\r\\\\nquestion in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\\\\r\\\\nsee him. I wonder I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t drop. I know that everything was turning\\\\r\\\\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\\\r\\\\nin my ear. I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\\\r\\\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\\\\r\\\\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\\\\r\\\\nbe still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\\\\r\\\\nhe was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\\\\r\\\\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\\\\r\\\\nreturned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\\\\r\\\\nhe made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\\\\r\\\\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\\\\r\\\\nhe might direct.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\\\r\\\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\\\\r\\\\nfew things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken\\\\r\\\\nto Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\\\\r\\\\nthose great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\\\\r\\\\nafterwards. I hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\\\\r\\\\nout of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me, and\\\\r\\\\nthen began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\\\\r\\\\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord\\\\r\\\\nSt. Simon to me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a\\\\r\\\\nlittle secret of his own before marriage also\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94but I managed to get\\\\r\\\\naway from her, and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and\\\\r\\\\naway we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that\\\\r\\\\nwas my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\\\\r\\\\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco, found that\\\\r\\\\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\\\\r\\\\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw it in a paper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d explained the American. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt gave the name and\\\\r\\\\nthe church, but not where the lady lived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\\\r\\\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\\\\r\\\\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94just sending\\\\r\\\\na line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful\\\\r\\\\nto me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that\\\\r\\\\nbreakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my\\\\r\\\\nwedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should\\\\r\\\\nnot be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find\\\\r\\\\nthem. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only\\\\r\\\\nthat this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening,\\\\r\\\\nthough how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very\\\\r\\\\nclearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that\\\\r\\\\nwe should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then\\\\r\\\\nhe offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and\\\\r\\\\nso we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have\\\\r\\\\nheard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope\\\\r\\\\nthat you do not think very meanly of me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\\\\r\\\\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\\\\r\\\\nnarrative.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\\\\r\\\\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forgive me? You won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shake hands before I go?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put out his hand\\\\r\\\\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had hoped,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d suggested Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat you would have joined us in a\\\\r\\\\nfriendly supper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that there you ask a little too much,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d responded his lordship.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\\\\r\\\\nhardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that, with your\\\\r\\\\npermission, I will now wish you all a very good-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He included us\\\\r\\\\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I trust that you at least will honor me with your company,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,\\\\r\\\\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and\\\\r\\\\nthe blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\\\\r\\\\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\\\\r\\\\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\\\\r\\\\nStars and Stripes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe case has been an interesting one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Holmes, when our\\\\r\\\\nvisitors had left us, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbecause it serves to show very clearly how\\\\r\\\\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\\\\r\\\\nto be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the\\\\r\\\\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\\\\r\\\\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland\\\\r\\\\nYard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I WILL WISH YOU ALL A VERY GOOD NIGHT.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\\\\r\\\\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\\\\r\\\\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\\\r\\\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\\\\r\\\\nto change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\\\r\\\\nspoken to any one when she was out, for she had been in the company\\\\r\\\\nof the bridegroom. Had she seen some one, then? If she had, it must\\\\r\\\\nbe some one from America, because she had spent so short a time in\\\\r\\\\nthis country that she could hardly have allowed any one to acquire so\\\\r\\\\ndeep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her\\\\r\\\\nto change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived,\\\\r\\\\nby a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\\\\r\\\\nAmerican. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so\\\\r\\\\nmuch influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband.\\\\r\\\\nHer young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\\\\r\\\\nstrange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\\\\r\\\\nSimon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\\\\r\\\\nthe bride\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\\\\r\\\\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\\\\r\\\\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94which in miners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\\\\r\\\\nprior claim to\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\\\\r\\\\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\\\\r\\\\nhusband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the chances being in favor of the latter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd how in the world did you find them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\\\r\\\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were\\\\r\\\\nof course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it\\\\r\\\\nto know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most\\\\r\\\\nselect London hotels.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you deduce the select?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eight-pence for a\\\\r\\\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are\\\\r\\\\nnot many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which\\\\r\\\\nI visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\\\\r\\\\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\\\\r\\\\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\\\\r\\\\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters\\\\r\\\\nwere to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and\\\\r\\\\nbeing fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to\\\\r\\\\ngive them some paternal advice, and to point out to them that it would\\\\r\\\\nbe better in every way that they should make their position a little\\\\r\\\\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\\\r\\\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\\\r\\\\nappointment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut with no very good result,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I remarked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis conduct was certainly\\\\r\\\\nnot very gracious.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cperhaps you would not be very\\\\r\\\\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\\\r\\\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\\\\r\\\\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully, and thank our stars\\\\r\\\\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw\\\\r\\\\nyour chair up, and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have\\\\r\\\\nstill to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure XI\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHolmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\\\r\\\\nthe street, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that\\\\r\\\\nhis relatives should allow him to come out alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend rose lazily from his arm-chair and stood with his hands in\\\\r\\\\nthe pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a\\\\r\\\\nbright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still\\\\r\\\\nlay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down\\\\r\\\\nthe centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly\\\\r\\\\nband by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of\\\\r\\\\nthe foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The gray pavement\\\\r\\\\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\\\\r\\\\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction\\\\r\\\\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\\\\r\\\\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\\\\r\\\\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed\\\\r\\\\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\\\\r\\\\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions were\\\\r\\\\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he\\\\r\\\\nwas running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man\\\\r\\\\ngives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran\\\\r\\\\nhe jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\\\\r\\\\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is looking up\\\\r\\\\nat the numbers of the houses.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe that he is coming here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\\\r\\\\nthat I recognize the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As he spoke,\\\\r\\\\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\\\\r\\\\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\\\\r\\\\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\\\\r\\\\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For\\\\r\\\\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\\\\r\\\\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\\\\r\\\\nreason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\\\\r\\\\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\\\\r\\\\nto the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\\\\r\\\\neasy-chair, and, sitting beside him, patted his hand, and chatted with\\\\r\\\\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\r\\\\nare fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\\\r\\\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\\\\r\\\\nproblem which you may submit to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\\\\r\\\\nhis emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\\\\r\\\\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo doubt you think me mad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see that you have had some great trouble,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d responded Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod knows I have!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,\\\\r\\\\nso sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,\\\\r\\\\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\\\\r\\\\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\\\\r\\\\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\\\\r\\\\nsoul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may\\\\r\\\\nsuffer, unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray compose yourself, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand let me have a clear\\\\r\\\\naccount of who you are, and what it is that has befallen you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered our visitor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis probably familiar to your ears.\\\\r\\\\nI am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\\\r\\\\nThreadneedle Street.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\\\\r\\\\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\\\\r\\\\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\\\\r\\\\nof London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until\\\\r\\\\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feel that time is of value,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat is why I hastened\\\\r\\\\nhere when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\\\r\\\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground, and hurried\\\\r\\\\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That\\\\r\\\\nis why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\\\\r\\\\nexercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\\\\r\\\\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\\\r\\\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\\\\r\\\\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\\\\r\\\\nnumber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out\\\\r\\\\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We\\\\r\\\\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\\\\r\\\\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\\\\r\\\\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\\\\r\\\\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the\\\\r\\\\nname, for it was that of none other than\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94well, perhaps even to you I\\\\r\\\\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\\\\r\\\\nword all over the earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94one of the highest, noblest, most exalted\\\\r\\\\nnames in England. I was overwhelmed by the honor, and attempted, when\\\\r\\\\nhe entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the\\\\r\\\\nair of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have been informed that you are in the habit\\\\r\\\\nof advancing money.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The firm do so when the security is good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is absolutely essential to me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98that I should have\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xa350,000 at once. I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten\\\\r\\\\ntimes over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of\\\\r\\\\nbusiness, and to carry out that business myself. In my position you\\\\r\\\\ncan readily understand that it is unwise to place one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s self under\\\\r\\\\nobligations.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\\\r\\\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\\\r\\\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should\\\\r\\\\nbe paid at once.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\\\\r\\\\nprivate purse,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98were it not that the strain would be rather\\\\r\\\\nmore than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\\\r\\\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\\\\r\\\\neven in your case, every business-like precaution should be taken.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should much prefer to have it so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, raising up a square,\\\\r\\\\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have\\\\r\\\\ndoubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Precisely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\\\\r\\\\nflesh-colored velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewelry which he\\\\r\\\\nhad named. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and the\\\\r\\\\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would\\\\r\\\\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\\\r\\\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\\\r\\\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You doubt its value?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Not at all. I only doubt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about\\\\r\\\\nthat. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\\\r\\\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter\\\\r\\\\nof form. Is the security sufficient?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ample.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\\\\r\\\\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\\\r\\\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\\\\r\\\\ngossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\\\\r\\\\nevery possible precaution, because I need not say that a great public\\\\r\\\\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to\\\\r\\\\nit would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\\\\r\\\\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\\\\r\\\\nreplace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\\\\r\\\\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but,\\\\r\\\\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 notes.\\\\r\\\\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\\\\r\\\\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\\\\r\\\\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no\\\\r\\\\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\\\\r\\\\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\\\r\\\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\\\\r\\\\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe, and turned once\\\\r\\\\nmore to my work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\\\r\\\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 safes had been\\\\r\\\\nforced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible\\\\r\\\\nwould be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\\\r\\\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\\\r\\\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out\\\\r\\\\nof my reach. With this intention, I called a cab, and drove out to\\\\r\\\\nmy house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe\\\\r\\\\nfreely until I had taken it up-stairs and locked it in the bureau of my\\\\r\\\\ndressing-room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\\\r\\\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\\\r\\\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants\\\\r\\\\nwho have been with me a number of years, and whose absolute reliability\\\\r\\\\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\\\\r\\\\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\\\\r\\\\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\\\\r\\\\npretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung\\\\r\\\\nabout the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her,\\\\r\\\\nbut we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will\\\\r\\\\nnot take me long to describe it. I am a widower, and have an only son,\\\\r\\\\nArthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a grievous\\\\r\\\\ndisappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell\\\\r\\\\nme that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died\\\\r\\\\nI felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\\\\r\\\\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.\\\\r\\\\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\\\\r\\\\nbut I meant it for the best.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\\\\r\\\\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,\\\\r\\\\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large\\\\r\\\\nsums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic\\\\r\\\\nclub, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\\\\r\\\\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\\\\r\\\\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\\\\r\\\\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\\\\r\\\\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honor. He tried more than\\\\r\\\\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\\\\r\\\\neach time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to\\\\r\\\\ndraw him back again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\\\r\\\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him\\\\r\\\\nto my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\\\\r\\\\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\\\\r\\\\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\\\\r\\\\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\\\\r\\\\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\\\\r\\\\nconvinced from his cynical speech, and the look which I have caught in\\\\r\\\\nhis eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,\\\\r\\\\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quick insight\\\\r\\\\ninto character.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when\\\\r\\\\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\\\\r\\\\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is\\\\r\\\\na sunbeam in my house\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager\\\\r\\\\nand house-keeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could\\\\r\\\\nbe. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\\\\r\\\\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\\\\r\\\\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\\\\r\\\\nhas refused him. I think that if any one could have drawn him into the\\\\r\\\\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\\\\r\\\\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for ever too\\\\r\\\\nlate!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\\\r\\\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night, after\\\\r\\\\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\\\\r\\\\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\\\\r\\\\nclient. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\\\\r\\\\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur\\\\r\\\\nwere much interested, and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\\\\r\\\\nthought it better not to disturb it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Where have you put it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 asked Arthur.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98In my own bureau.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, I hope to goodness the house won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be burgled during the\\\\r\\\\nnight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is locked up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\\\r\\\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\\\\r\\\\nhe said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\\\\r\\\\ngrave face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Look here, dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, with his eyes cast down, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98can you let me\\\\r\\\\nhave \\\\xc2\\\\xa3200?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, I cannot!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have been far too generous\\\\r\\\\nwith you in money matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have been very kind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98but I must have this money, or\\\\r\\\\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And a very good thing, too!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonored man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and\\\\r\\\\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You\\\\r\\\\nshall not have a farthing from me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried; on which he bowed and left\\\\r\\\\nthe room without another word.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\\\r\\\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see\\\\r\\\\nthat all was secure\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I\\\\r\\\\nthought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs\\\\r\\\\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\\\\r\\\\nfastened as I approached.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tell me, dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98did\\\\r\\\\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Certainly not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has\\\\r\\\\nonly been to the side gate to see some one; but I think that it is\\\\r\\\\nhardly safe, and should be stopped.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You must speak to her in the morning, or I will, if you prefer it.\\\\r\\\\nAre you sure that everything is fastened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quite sure, dad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Then, good-night.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I kissed her, and went up to my bedroom again,\\\\r\\\\nwhere I was soon asleep.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am endeavoring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have\\\\r\\\\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\\\\r\\\\npoint which I do not make clear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\\\r\\\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\\\r\\\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two\\\\r\\\\nin the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It\\\\r\\\\nhad ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind\\\\r\\\\nit as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening\\\\r\\\\nwith all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound\\\\r\\\\nof footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\\\\r\\\\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\\\\r\\\\ndoor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Arthur!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I screamed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that\\\\r\\\\ncoronet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\\\\r\\\\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\\\\r\\\\nthe coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\\\\r\\\\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and\\\\r\\\\nturned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\\\\r\\\\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You blackguard!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have\\\\r\\\\ndestroyed it! You have dishonored me for ever! Where are the jewels\\\\r\\\\nwhich you have stolen?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Stolen!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, you thief!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you\\\\r\\\\na liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another\\\\r\\\\npiece?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You have called me names enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I will not stand it any\\\\r\\\\nlonger. I shall not say another word about this business since you have\\\\r\\\\nchosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my\\\\r\\\\nown way in the world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I cried, half-mad\\\\r\\\\nwith grief and rage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You shall learn nothing from me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, with a passion such as I\\\\r\\\\nshould not have thought was in his nature. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98If you choose to call the\\\\r\\\\npolice, let the police find what they can.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\\\\r\\\\nmy anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\\\\r\\\\nthe coronet and of Arthur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, she read the whole story, and, with\\\\r\\\\na scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for\\\\r\\\\nthe police, and put the investigation into their hands at once. When\\\\r\\\\nthe inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\\\\r\\\\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\\\r\\\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\\\\r\\\\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\\\\r\\\\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\\\\r\\\\neverything.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98At least,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you will not have me arrested at once. It would\\\\r\\\\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\\\\r\\\\nfive minutes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\\\\r\\\\nstolen,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. And then realizing the dreadful position in which I\\\\r\\\\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that\\\\r\\\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\\\\r\\\\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\\\\r\\\\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\\\r\\\\nstones.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You may as well face the matter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you have been caught in\\\\r\\\\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you\\\\r\\\\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\\\\r\\\\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he answered, turning\\\\r\\\\naway from me, with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any\\\\r\\\\nwords of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called\\\\r\\\\nin the inspector, and gave him into custody. A search was made at once,\\\\r\\\\nnot only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the\\\\r\\\\nhouse where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of\\\\r\\\\nthem could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all\\\\r\\\\nour persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell,\\\\r\\\\nand I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried\\\\r\\\\nround to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the\\\\r\\\\nmatter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make\\\\r\\\\nnothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I\\\\r\\\\nhave already offered a reward of \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000. My God, what shall I do! I have\\\\r\\\\nlost my honor, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head, and rocked himself to and\\\\r\\\\nfro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\\\r\\\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you receive much company?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone, save my partner with his family, and an occasional friend of\\\\r\\\\nArthur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one\\\\r\\\\nelse, I think.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you go out much in society?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is unusual in a young girl.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\\\r\\\\nfour-and-twenty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\\\r\\\\nalso.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guilt?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow can we have, when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\\\\r\\\\nhis hands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\\\r\\\\ncoronet at all injured?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, it was twisted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\\\r\\\\nit?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it\\\\r\\\\nis too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose\\\\r\\\\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\\\r\\\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\\\\r\\\\npoints about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\\\\r\\\\nawoke you from your sleep?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s closing his\\\\r\\\\nbedroom door.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\\\\r\\\\nto wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\\\\r\\\\nthese gems?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\\\r\\\\nhope of finding them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\\\\r\\\\nalready been minutely examined.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, my dear sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis it not obvious to you now that\\\\r\\\\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\\\r\\\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\\\\r\\\\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\\\\r\\\\ninvolved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\\\\r\\\\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\\\\r\\\\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of\\\\r\\\\nit, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\\\\r\\\\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\\\r\\\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\\\\r\\\\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\\\\r\\\\nsuch a theory tenable?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what other is there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the banker, with a gesture of despair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is our task to find that out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d replied Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso now, if you\\\\r\\\\nplease, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\\\r\\\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,\\\\r\\\\nwhich I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were\\\\r\\\\ndeeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that\\\\r\\\\nthe guilt of the banker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it\\\\r\\\\ndid to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\njudgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long\\\\r\\\\nas he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke\\\\r\\\\na word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin\\\\r\\\\nupon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\\\\r\\\\nthought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little\\\\r\\\\nglimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into\\\\r\\\\na desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\\\\r\\\\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\\\\r\\\\nof the great financier.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back\\\\r\\\\na little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad\\\\r\\\\nlawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\\\\r\\\\nentrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\\\\r\\\\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\\\\r\\\\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s entrance. On the left ran a\\\\r\\\\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds\\\\r\\\\nat all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left\\\\r\\\\nus standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across\\\\r\\\\nthe front, down the tradesmen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s path, and so round by the garden behind\\\\r\\\\ninto the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\\\\r\\\\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\\\\r\\\\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\\\r\\\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\\\\r\\\\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\\\\r\\\\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\r\\\\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\\\\r\\\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\\\r\\\\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\\\\r\\\\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\\\\r\\\\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence,\\\\r\\\\nshe went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with\\\\r\\\\na sweet womanly caress.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\\\r\\\\ndad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instincts\\\\r\\\\nare. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\\\r\\\\nhaving acted so harshly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\\\r\\\\nhim.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\\\r\\\\ncoronet in his hand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh do, do take my word\\\\r\\\\nfor it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is\\\\r\\\\nso dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94never, Mary! Your\\\\r\\\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\\\r\\\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\\\r\\\\nto inquire more deeply into it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis gentleman?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked, facing round to me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\\\r\\\\nstable lane now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe stable lane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She raised her dark eyebrows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can he hope to\\\\r\\\\nfind there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\\\r\\\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\\\\r\\\\nArthur is innocent of this crime.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\\\r\\\\nit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\\\r\\\\nshoes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI believe I have the honor of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\\\r\\\\nMight I ask you a question or two?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\\\\r\\\\nI came down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\\\r\\\\nthe windows?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere they all fastened this morning?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\\\\r\\\\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\\\r\\\\nhave heard uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s remarks about the coronet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\\\\r\\\\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the banker,\\\\r\\\\nimpatiently, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\\\\r\\\\nin his hands?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\\\r\\\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\\\\r\\\\nher slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes; he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\\\r\\\\nname is Francis Prosper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe stood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto the left of the door\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that is to say,\\\\r\\\\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, he did.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expressive black\\\\r\\\\neyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, you are like a magician,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s thin, eager\\\\r\\\\nface.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should be very glad now to go up-stairs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall probably\\\\r\\\\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\\\r\\\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\\\\r\\\\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\\\\r\\\\nopened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\\\\r\\\\npowerful magnifying lens. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow we shall go up-stairs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, at last.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe banker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\\\\r\\\\na gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\\\\r\\\\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich key was used to open it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat which my son himself indicated\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that of the cupboard of the\\\\r\\\\nlumber-room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you it here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is it on the dressing-table.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a noiseless lock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is no wonder that it did not\\\\r\\\\nwake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\\\r\\\\nlook at it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it\\\\r\\\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s art,\\\\r\\\\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\\\\r\\\\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\\\\r\\\\ngems had been torn away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chere is the corner which corresponds\\\\r\\\\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\\\\r\\\\nbreak it off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should not dream of trying,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I will.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\\\\r\\\\nresult. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feel it give a little,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut, though I am\\\\r\\\\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\\\\r\\\\nbreak it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\\\r\\\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\\\\r\\\\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\\\\r\\\\nof your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\\\r\\\\nHolder?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI confess that I still share my uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perplexity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you. We have certainly been favored with extraordinary luck\\\\r\\\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\\\r\\\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\\\\r\\\\nshall now continue my investigations outside.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\\\\r\\\\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\\\\r\\\\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\\\\r\\\\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nsaid he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot tell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe banker wrung his hands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall never see them again!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy opinion is in no way altered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, for God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\\\\r\\\\nmy house last night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\\\r\\\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\\\\r\\\\nclearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\\\\r\\\\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\\\\r\\\\nthe sum I may draw.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would give my fortune to have them back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\\\\r\\\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\\\\r\\\\nbefore evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was now made up about\\\\r\\\\nthe case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could\\\\r\\\\neven dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I\\\\r\\\\nendeavored to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to\\\\r\\\\nsome other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not\\\\r\\\\nyet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. He hurried to\\\\r\\\\nhis chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common\\\\r\\\\nloafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red\\\\r\\\\ncravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that this should do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, glancing into the glass above\\\\r\\\\nthe fireplace. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but\\\\r\\\\nI fear that it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I\\\\r\\\\nmay be following a will-of-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it\\\\r\\\\nis. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He cut a slice of beef\\\\r\\\\nfrom the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\\\\r\\\\nbread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off\\\\r\\\\nupon his expedition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\\\\r\\\\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\\\\r\\\\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI only looked in as I passed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am going right on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\\\\r\\\\nget back. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wait up for me in case I should be late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow are you getting on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\\\\r\\\\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\\\\r\\\\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\\\\r\\\\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\\\\r\\\\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\\\\r\\\\nthan his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\\\\r\\\\na touch of color upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened up-stairs, and a\\\\r\\\\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\\\\r\\\\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\\\\r\\\\nretired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\\\\r\\\\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\\\\r\\\\nlateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\\\\r\\\\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a\\\\r\\\\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\\\\r\\\\nas possible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut you\\\\r\\\\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy, it is after nine now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should not be surprised if\\\\r\\\\nthat were he. I thought I heard a ring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\\\\r\\\\nwhich had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad\\\\r\\\\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\\\\r\\\\nto me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\\\\r\\\\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\\\\r\\\\nand he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which I pushed forward for\\\\r\\\\nhim.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\\\r\\\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonored age. One sorrow\\\\r\\\\ncomes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDeserted you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\\\\r\\\\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\\\\r\\\\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\\\\r\\\\nmight have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\\\\r\\\\nso. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98MY DEAREST UNCLE,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I feel that I have brought trouble\\\\r\\\\n  upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible\\\\r\\\\n  misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this\\\\r\\\\n  thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and\\\\r\\\\n  I feel that I must leave you for ever. Do not worry about my\\\\r\\\\n  future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search\\\\r\\\\n  for me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to\\\\r\\\\n  me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving       MARY.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points\\\\r\\\\nto suicide?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.\\\\r\\\\nI trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\\\r\\\\nsomething! Where are the gems?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou would not think \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would pay ten.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\\\r\\\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a\\\\r\\\\npen. Better make it out for \\\\xc2\\\\xa34000 pounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked\\\\r\\\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\\\\r\\\\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am saved! I am saved!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\\\\r\\\\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Sherlock Holmes,\\\\r\\\\nrather sternly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOwe!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He caught up a pen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cName the sum, and I will pay it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\\\r\\\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\\\\r\\\\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know\\\\r\\\\nthat the truth is known.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\\\r\\\\nwith him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it\\\\r\\\\nto him, on which he had to confess that I was right, and to add the\\\\r\\\\nvery few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of\\\\r\\\\nthis morning, however, may open his lips.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor Heaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\\\r\\\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\\\\r\\\\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\\\\r\\\\nBurnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy Mary? Impossible!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain. Neither you\\\\r\\\\nnor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted\\\\r\\\\nhim into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in\\\\r\\\\nEngland\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man\\\\r\\\\nwithout heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When\\\\r\\\\nhe breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her,\\\\r\\\\nshe flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil\\\\r\\\\nknows best what he said, but at least she became his tool, and was in\\\\r\\\\nthe habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried the banker, with an ashen\\\\r\\\\nface.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\\\r\\\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\\\\r\\\\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\\\\r\\\\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had\\\\r\\\\nhe stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold\\\\r\\\\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt\\\\r\\\\nthat she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\\\\r\\\\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\\\\r\\\\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\\\r\\\\ndown-stairs, on which she closed the window rapidly, and told you about\\\\r\\\\none of the servants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\\\\r\\\\nall perfectly true.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but\\\\r\\\\nhe slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.\\\\r\\\\nIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so\\\\r\\\\nhe rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking\\\\r\\\\nvery stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your\\\\r\\\\ndressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\\\\r\\\\nclothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\\\\r\\\\nstrange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\\\r\\\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\\\\r\\\\ncoronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\\\\r\\\\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\\\\r\\\\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\\\\r\\\\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to some one in the\\\\r\\\\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\\\\r\\\\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without\\\\r\\\\na horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that\\\\r\\\\nshe was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for\\\\r\\\\nyou, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just\\\\r\\\\nas he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the\\\\r\\\\nsnow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\\\\r\\\\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\\\\r\\\\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\\\\r\\\\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\\\\r\\\\nyour son struck Sir George, and cut him over the eye. Then something\\\\r\\\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\\\\r\\\\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\\\\r\\\\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and\\\\r\\\\nwas endeavoring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs it possible?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped the banker.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\\\\r\\\\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain\\\\r\\\\nthe true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\\\\r\\\\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\\\\r\\\\nview, however, and preserved her secret.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\ncried Mr. Holder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\\\r\\\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\\\\r\\\\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\\\r\\\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I arrived at the house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d continued Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI at once went very\\\\r\\\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\\\r\\\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\\\r\\\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\\\\r\\\\nimpressions. I passed along the tradesmen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s path, but found it all\\\\r\\\\ntrampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\\\\r\\\\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\\\\r\\\\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.\\\\r\\\\nI could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\\\r\\\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\\\\r\\\\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.\\\\r\\\\nI thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart,\\\\r\\\\nof whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\\\\r\\\\nI passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\\\\r\\\\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\\\r\\\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\\\\r\\\\nme.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\\\r\\\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\\\\r\\\\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\\\\r\\\\nson. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly,\\\\r\\\\nand, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot,\\\\r\\\\nit was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up,\\\\r\\\\nand found that they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all\\\\r\\\\nthe snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was\\\\r\\\\na hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\\\\r\\\\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,\\\\r\\\\nand, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I\\\\r\\\\nwas not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little\\\\r\\\\nsmudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came\\\\r\\\\nto the high-road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been\\\\r\\\\ncleared, so there was an end to that clew.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\\\r\\\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once\\\\r\\\\nsee that some one had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of\\\\r\\\\nan instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\\\\r\\\\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\\\\r\\\\nhad waited outside the window, some one had brought the gems; the deed\\\\r\\\\nhad been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled\\\\r\\\\nwith him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\\\\r\\\\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\\\\r\\\\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\\\r\\\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man,\\\\r\\\\nand who was it brought him the coronet?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\\\r\\\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\\\\r\\\\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\\\\r\\\\nyour niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son\\\\r\\\\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\\\\r\\\\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\\\\r\\\\nexplanation why he should retain her secret\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the more so as the secret\\\\r\\\\nwas a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at\\\\r\\\\nthat window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\\\\r\\\\nconjecture became a certainty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\\\\r\\\\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\\\\r\\\\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\\\\r\\\\nwas a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had\\\\r\\\\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It\\\\r\\\\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\\\\r\\\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\\\\r\\\\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\\\\r\\\\nwithout compromising his own family.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I\\\\r\\\\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house, managed to pick\\\\r\\\\nup an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\\\\r\\\\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\\\\r\\\\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I\\\\r\\\\njourneyed down to Streatham, and saw that they exactly fitted the\\\\r\\\\ntracks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHolder.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\\\r\\\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\\\\r\\\\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\\\r\\\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\\\\r\\\\nmatter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.\\\\r\\\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\\\\r\\\\nbluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\\\\r\\\\nThen he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\\\\r\\\\nhim a price for the stones he held\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 apiece. That brought out the\\\\r\\\\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, dash it all!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I soon managed to get\\\\r\\\\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\\\\r\\\\nwould be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\\\\r\\\\ngot our stones at \\\\xc2\\\\xa31000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told\\\\r\\\\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\r\\\\nafter what I may call a really hard day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\r\\\\nbanker, rising. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\\\r\\\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed\\\\r\\\\nexceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy\\\\r\\\\nto apologize to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you\\\\r\\\\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can\\\\r\\\\ninform me where she is now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that we may safely say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d returned Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat she is\\\\r\\\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\\\\r\\\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\\\\r\\\\npunishment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdventure XII\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\\\r\\\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit is\\\\r\\\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the\\\\r\\\\nkeenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,\\\\r\\\\nWatson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little\\\\r\\\\nrecords of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I\\\\r\\\\nam bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence\\\\r\\\\nnot so much to the many _causes c\\\\xc3\\\\xa9l\\\\xc3\\\\xa8bres_ and sensational trials in\\\\r\\\\nwhich I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been\\\\r\\\\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties\\\\r\\\\nof deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\\\\r\\\\nprovince.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd yet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from\\\\r\\\\nthe charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have erred, perhaps,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\\\r\\\\nthe tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was\\\\r\\\\nwont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious, rather than a\\\\r\\\\nmeditative mood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and\\\\r\\\\nlife into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the\\\\r\\\\ntask of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect\\\\r\\\\nwhich is really the only notable feature about the thing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I\\\\r\\\\nremarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which\\\\r\\\\nI had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nsingular character.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, answering, as was his\\\\r\\\\nwont, my thoughts rather than my words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I claim full justice for my\\\\r\\\\nart, it is because it is an impersonal thing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a thing beyond myself.\\\\r\\\\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather\\\\r\\\\nthan upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what\\\\r\\\\nshould have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast\\\\r\\\\non either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A\\\\r\\\\nthick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-colored houses, and the\\\\r\\\\nopposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy\\\\r\\\\nyellow wreaths. Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth and\\\\r\\\\nglimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.\\\\r\\\\nSherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously\\\\r\\\\ninto the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at\\\\r\\\\nlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very\\\\r\\\\nsweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt the same time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat\\\\r\\\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou can hardly\\\\r\\\\nbe open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\\\\r\\\\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not\\\\r\\\\ntreat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I\\\\r\\\\nendeavored to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss\\\\r\\\\nMary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted\\\\r\\\\nlip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are\\\\r\\\\noutside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear\\\\r\\\\nthat you may have bordered on the trivial.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe end may have been so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I answered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut the methods I hold to have\\\\r\\\\nbeen novel and of interest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\\\\r\\\\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by\\\\r\\\\nhis left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!\\\\r\\\\nBut, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of\\\\r\\\\nthe great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all\\\\r\\\\nenterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to\\\\r\\\\nbe degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\\\r\\\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I\\\\r\\\\nhave touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning\\\\r\\\\nmarks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He tossed a crumpled letter\\\\r\\\\nacross to me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran\\\\r\\\\nthus:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94I am very anxious to consult you as\\\\r\\\\n  to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has\\\\r\\\\n  been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten\\\\r\\\\n  to-morrow, if I do not inconvenience you.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYours faithfully,     VIOLET HUNTER.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know the young lady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot I.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is half-past ten now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember\\\\r\\\\nthat the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim\\\\r\\\\nat first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\\\r\\\\ncase, also.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for\\\\r\\\\nhere, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\\\r\\\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a\\\\r\\\\nplover\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own\\\\r\\\\nway to make in the world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she, as my\\\\r\\\\ncompanion rose to greet her; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I have had a very strange experience,\\\\r\\\\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask\\\\r\\\\nadvice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what\\\\r\\\\nI should do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\\\\r\\\\ncan to serve you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI could see that Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and\\\\r\\\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,\\\\r\\\\nand then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger tips\\\\r\\\\ntogether, to listen to her story.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have been a governess for five years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cin the family\\\\r\\\\nof Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\\\\r\\\\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over\\\\r\\\\nto America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I\\\\r\\\\nadvertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last\\\\r\\\\nthe little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my\\\\r\\\\nwits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 end as to what I should do.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\\\\r\\\\nWestaway\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to\\\\r\\\\nsee whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was\\\\r\\\\nthe name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by\\\\r\\\\nMiss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are\\\\r\\\\nseeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by\\\\r\\\\none, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything\\\\r\\\\nwhich would suit them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\\\\r\\\\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout\\\\r\\\\nman with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down\\\\r\\\\nin fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of\\\\r\\\\nglasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.\\\\r\\\\nAs I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to\\\\r\\\\nMiss Stoper:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98That will do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I could not ask for anything better. Capital!\\\\r\\\\ncapital!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together\\\\r\\\\nin the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that\\\\r\\\\nit was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You are looking for a situation, miss?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98As governess?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Yes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And what salary do you ask?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I had \\\\xc2\\\\xa34 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, tut, tut! sweating\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94rank sweating!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried, throwing his fat\\\\r\\\\nhands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98How\\\\r\\\\ncould any one offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions\\\\r\\\\nand accomplishments?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98A\\\\r\\\\nlittle French, a little German, music, and drawing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Tut, tut!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98This is all quite beside the question. The\\\\r\\\\npoint is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a\\\\r\\\\nlady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted\\\\r\\\\nfor the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part\\\\r\\\\nin the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could\\\\r\\\\nany gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three\\\\r\\\\nfigures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 a year.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\\\\r\\\\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing\\\\r\\\\nperhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and\\\\r\\\\ntook out a note.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is also my custom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion\\\\r\\\\nuntil his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white\\\\r\\\\ncreases of his face, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98to advance to my young ladies half their salary\\\\r\\\\nbeforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\\\\r\\\\nand their wardrobe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful\\\\r\\\\na man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a\\\\r\\\\ngreat convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the\\\\r\\\\nwhole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I\\\\r\\\\nquite committed myself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98May I ask where you live, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the\\\\r\\\\nfar side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young\\\\r\\\\nlady, and the dearest old country-house.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98One child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could\\\\r\\\\nsee him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three\\\\r\\\\ngone before you could wink!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He leaned back in his chair and laughed\\\\r\\\\nhis eyes into his head again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amusement, but\\\\r\\\\nthe father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My sole duties, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98are to take charge of a single child?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he cried.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to\\\\r\\\\nobey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they\\\\r\\\\nwere such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty, heh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I should be happy to make myself useful.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\\\\r\\\\nknow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which\\\\r\\\\nwe might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, no.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my\\\\r\\\\nhair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.\\\\r\\\\nIt has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in\\\\r\\\\nthis off-hand fashion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I. He had been\\\\r\\\\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\\\\r\\\\npass over his face as I spoke.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am afraid that it is quite essential,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is a little\\\\r\\\\nfancy of my wife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and ladies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nfancies must be consulted. And so you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cut your hair?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, sir, I really could not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered, firmly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,\\\\r\\\\nbecause in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In\\\\r\\\\nthat case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young\\\\r\\\\nladies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\\\\r\\\\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance\\\\r\\\\nupon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a\\\\r\\\\nhandsome commission through my refusal.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 she asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98If you please, Miss Stoper.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most\\\\r\\\\nexcellent offers in this fashion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You can hardly\\\\r\\\\nexpect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\\\r\\\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 She struck a gong upon the table, and I\\\\r\\\\nwas shown out by the page.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little\\\\r\\\\nenough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began\\\\r\\\\nto ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,\\\\r\\\\nif these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most\\\\r\\\\nextraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their\\\\r\\\\neccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting \\\\xc2\\\\xa3100 a\\\\r\\\\nyear. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by\\\\r\\\\nwearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I\\\\r\\\\nwas inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after\\\\r\\\\nI was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back\\\\r\\\\nto the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when I\\\\r\\\\nreceived this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I\\\\r\\\\nwill read it to you:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98DEAR MISS HUNTER,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\\\r\\\\n    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\\\\r\\\\n    reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you\\\\r\\\\n    should come, for she has been much attracted by my description\\\\r\\\\n    of you. We are willing to give \\\\xc2\\\\xa330 a quarter, or \\\\xc2\\\\xa3120 a year, so\\\\r\\\\n    as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads\\\\r\\\\n    may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife\\\\r\\\\n    is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like\\\\r\\\\n    you to wear such a dress in-doors in the morning. You need not,\\\\r\\\\n    however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one\\\\r\\\\n    belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which\\\\r\\\\n    would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting\\\\r\\\\n    here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that\\\\r\\\\n    need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is\\\\r\\\\n    no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its\\\\r\\\\n    beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must\\\\r\\\\n    remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased\\\\r\\\\n    salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as\\\\r\\\\n    the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and\\\\r\\\\n    I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know\\\\r\\\\n    your train.         Yours faithfully,      JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\\\\r\\\\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before\\\\r\\\\ntaking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\\\\r\\\\nconsideration.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\\\r\\\\nquestion,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, smiling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\\\\r\\\\nsister of mine apply for.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed\\\\r\\\\nsome opinion?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\\\r\\\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his\\\\r\\\\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear\\\\r\\\\nshe should be taken to an asylum, and that he humors her fancies in\\\\r\\\\nevery way in order to prevent an outbreak.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is a possible solution\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\\\r\\\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household\\\\r\\\\nfor a young lady.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94too good. That is what makes\\\\r\\\\nme uneasy. Why should they give you \\\\xc2\\\\xa3120 a year, when they could have\\\\r\\\\ntheir pick for \\\\xc2\\\\xa340? There must be some strong reason behind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\\\\r\\\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I\\\\r\\\\nfelt that you were at the back of me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\\\\r\\\\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my\\\\r\\\\nway for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of\\\\r\\\\nthe features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt would cease to be a danger if we\\\\r\\\\ncould define it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram\\\\r\\\\nwould bring me down to your help.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety\\\\r\\\\nall swept from her face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in\\\\r\\\\nmy mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor\\\\r\\\\nhair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d With a few grateful\\\\r\\\\nwords to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her\\\\r\\\\nway.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt least,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the\\\\r\\\\nstairs, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take\\\\r\\\\ncare of herself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd she would need to be,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, gravely; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am much mistaken\\\\r\\\\nif we do not hear from her before many days are past.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was not very long before my friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s prediction was fulfilled. A\\\\r\\\\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning\\\\r\\\\nin her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human\\\\r\\\\nexperience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary,\\\\r\\\\nthe curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something\\\\r\\\\nabnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were\\\\r\\\\na philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to\\\\r\\\\ndetermine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an\\\\r\\\\nhour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\\\\r\\\\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cData! data!\\\\r\\\\ndata!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make bricks without clay.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And\\\\r\\\\nyet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\\\r\\\\never have accepted such a situation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as\\\\r\\\\nI was thinking of turning in, and Holmes was settling down to one of\\\\r\\\\nthose all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in,\\\\r\\\\nwhen I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night,\\\\r\\\\nand find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in\\\\r\\\\nthe morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the\\\\r\\\\nmessage, threw it across to me.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, and turned back to his\\\\r\\\\nchemical studies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlease be at the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Black Swan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hotel at Winchester at\\\\r\\\\n  mid-day to-morrow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo come! I am at my wits\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n  end.                                       HUNTER.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you come with me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes, glancing up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should wish to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust look it up, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is a train at half-past nine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I, glancing over my\\\\r\\\\nBradshaw. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is due at Winchester at 11.30.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\\\\r\\\\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\\\\r\\\\nmorning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\\\\r\\\\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the\\\\r\\\\nway down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them\\\\r\\\\ndown, and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a\\\\r\\\\nlight blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across\\\\r\\\\nfrom west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\\\\r\\\\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s energy.\\\\r\\\\nAll over the country-side, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,\\\\r\\\\nthe little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from\\\\r\\\\namid the light green of the new foliage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried, with all the enthusiasm of\\\\r\\\\na man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you know, Watson,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat it is one of the curses of a mind\\\\r\\\\nwith a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to\\\\r\\\\nmy own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\\\\r\\\\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which\\\\r\\\\ncomes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with\\\\r\\\\nwhich crime may be committed there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood heavens!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho would associate crime with these dear old\\\\r\\\\nhomesteads?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\\\\r\\\\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London\\\\r\\\\ndo not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and\\\\r\\\\nbeautiful country-side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou horrify me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can\\\\r\\\\ndo in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so\\\\r\\\\nvile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nblow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and\\\\r\\\\nthen the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of\\\\r\\\\ncomplaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime\\\\r\\\\nand the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\\\\r\\\\nfilled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of\\\\r\\\\nthe law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness\\\\r\\\\nwhich may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.\\\\r\\\\nHad this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\\\\r\\\\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country\\\\r\\\\nwhich makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally\\\\r\\\\nthreatened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuite so. She has her freedom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\\\\r\\\\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can\\\\r\\\\nonly be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\\\\r\\\\nfind waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\\\\r\\\\nshall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlack Swan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no\\\\r\\\\ndistance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting\\\\r\\\\nfor us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon\\\\r\\\\nthe table.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am so delighted that you have come,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, earnestly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is so\\\\r\\\\nvery kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your\\\\r\\\\nadvice will be altogether invaluable to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray tell us what has happened to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\\\\r\\\\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,\\\\r\\\\nthough he little knew for what purpose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet us have everything in its due order.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Holmes thrust his long thin\\\\r\\\\nlegs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\\\\r\\\\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to\\\\r\\\\nthem to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\\\\r\\\\nmind about them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can you not understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as\\\\r\\\\nit occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here, and drove me\\\\r\\\\nin his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\\\\r\\\\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\\\\r\\\\nblock of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\\\\r\\\\nand bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\\\\r\\\\non the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high-road,\\\\r\\\\nwhich curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\\\\r\\\\nground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\\\\r\\\\nof Lord Southerton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately\\\\r\\\\nin front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n[Illustration: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\\\r\\\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\\\r\\\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\\\\r\\\\nin your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her\\\\r\\\\nto be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not\\\\r\\\\nmore than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\\\\r\\\\nforty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\\\\r\\\\nmarried about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\\\\r\\\\nchild by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\\\\r\\\\nMr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\\\\r\\\\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her step-mother. As the\\\\r\\\\ndaughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\\\\r\\\\nher position must have been uncomfortable with her father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s young wife.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colorless in mind as well as in\\\\r\\\\nfeature. She impressed me neither favorably nor the reverse. She was a\\\\r\\\\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both\\\\r\\\\nto her husband and to her little son. Her light gray eyes wandered\\\\r\\\\ncontinually from one to the other, noting every little want and\\\\r\\\\nforestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\\\\r\\\\nboisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\\\\r\\\\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\\\\r\\\\nin deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\\\\r\\\\nhave surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\\\\r\\\\ndisposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\\\\r\\\\nmet so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small\\\\r\\\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His\\\\r\\\\nwhole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of\\\\r\\\\npassion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature\\\\r\\\\nweaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he\\\\r\\\\nshows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little\\\\r\\\\nbirds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr.\\\\r\\\\nHolmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am glad of all details,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked my friend, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhether they seem to\\\\r\\\\nyou to be relevant or not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\\\\r\\\\nthing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance\\\\r\\\\nand conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\\\\r\\\\nToller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\\\\r\\\\nhair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\\\\r\\\\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\\\\r\\\\ntake no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\\\\r\\\\nsour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle, and much less amiable. They are\\\\r\\\\na most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in\\\\r\\\\nthe nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner\\\\r\\\\nof the building.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\\\r\\\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\\\r\\\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, turning to me; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98we are very much obliged to you,\\\\r\\\\nMiss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\\\\r\\\\nI assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\\\\r\\\\nappearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\\\\r\\\\nyou. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\\\\r\\\\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\\\\r\\\\nblue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\\\\r\\\\nunmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been\\\\r\\\\na better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\\\\r\\\\nexpressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\\\\r\\\\nin its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\\\\r\\\\nis a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\\\\r\\\\nwith three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\\\\r\\\\nplaced close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\\\\r\\\\nthis I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\\\r\\\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\\\\r\\\\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\\\\r\\\\nwas, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\\\\r\\\\nhas evidently no sense of humor, never so much as smiled, but sat with\\\\r\\\\nher hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\\\\r\\\\nhour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\\\\r\\\\nthe duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\\\\r\\\\nlittle Edward in the nursery.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\\\r\\\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\\\\r\\\\nwindow, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\\\\r\\\\nmy employer had an immense _r\\\\xc3\\\\xa9pertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\\\\r\\\\nThen he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little\\\\r\\\\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\\\\r\\\\nto read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\\\\r\\\\nheart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\\\\r\\\\nordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\\\\r\\\\nthe meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\\\\r\\\\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\\\\r\\\\nwindow, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\\\\r\\\\non behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\\\\r\\\\ndevised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\\\\r\\\\nseized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\\\\r\\\\nthe next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\\\\r\\\\nup to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\\\\r\\\\nthere was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\\\\r\\\\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\\\\r\\\\nRoad, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in\\\\r\\\\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\\\\r\\\\npeople there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings\\\\r\\\\nwhich bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\\\\r\\\\nhandkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle, to find her eyes fixed upon\\\\r\\\\nme with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\\\\r\\\\nthat she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what\\\\r\\\\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Jephro,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said she, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\\\\r\\\\nthere who stares up at Miss Hunter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No; I know no one in these parts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\\\r\\\\ngo away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Surely it would be better to take no notice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\\\\r\\\\nand wave him away like that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\\\\r\\\\nthe blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\\\\r\\\\nin the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\\\\r\\\\nroad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPray continue,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour narrative promises to be a most\\\\r\\\\ninteresting one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\\\\r\\\\nbe little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.\\\\r\\\\nOn the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle\\\\r\\\\ntook me to a small out-house which stands near the kitchen door. As we\\\\r\\\\napproached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\\\\r\\\\nof a large animal moving about.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Look in here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\\\\r\\\\nplanks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Is he not a beauty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a\\\\r\\\\nvague figure huddled up in the darkness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be frightened,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said my employer, laughing at the start which I\\\\r\\\\nhad given. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\\\\r\\\\nold Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\\\\r\\\\nfeed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\\\\r\\\\nkeen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\\\\r\\\\ntrespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sake don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you\\\\r\\\\never on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\\\\r\\\\nis as much as your life is worth.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\\\\r\\\\nout of my bedroom window about two o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. It was a\\\\r\\\\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\\\\r\\\\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in\\\\r\\\\nthe peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\\\\r\\\\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\\\\r\\\\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\\\\r\\\\ntawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\\\\r\\\\nbones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\\\\r\\\\nupon the other side. That dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my\\\\r\\\\nheart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\\\\r\\\\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil\\\\r\\\\nat the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed,\\\\r\\\\nI began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\\\\r\\\\nrearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers\\\\r\\\\nin the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.\\\\r\\\\nI had filled the first two with my linen, and, as I had still much\\\\r\\\\nto pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the\\\\r\\\\nthird drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\\\\r\\\\noversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The\\\\r\\\\nvery first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There\\\\r\\\\nwas only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what\\\\r\\\\nit was. It was my coil of hair.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\\\\r\\\\nthe same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\\\\r\\\\nitself upon me. How _could_ my hair have been locked in the drawer?\\\\r\\\\nWith trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and\\\\r\\\\ndrew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and\\\\r\\\\nI assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\\\\r\\\\nas I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\\\\r\\\\nthe strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\\\\r\\\\nRucastles, as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\\\\r\\\\ndrawer which they had locked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\\\r\\\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\\\\r\\\\none wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\\\\r\\\\nwhich faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened\\\\r\\\\ninto this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\\\\r\\\\nascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\\\\r\\\\nhis keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\\\\r\\\\ndifferent person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\\\\r\\\\ncheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\\\\r\\\\nstood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\\\\r\\\\npast me without a word or a look.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis aroused my curiosity; so when I went out for a walk in the\\\\r\\\\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\\\\r\\\\nsee the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\\\\r\\\\nrow, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\\\\r\\\\nup. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\\\\r\\\\nglancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\\\\r\\\\nmerry and jovial as ever.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Ah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\\\\r\\\\nword, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI assured him that I was not offended. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98By-the-way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said I, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98you\\\\r\\\\nseem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has\\\\r\\\\nthe shutters up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\\\\r\\\\nremark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Photography is one of my hobbies,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I have made my dark room\\\\r\\\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\\\r\\\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He spoke\\\\r\\\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\\\\r\\\\nme. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\\\r\\\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\\\\r\\\\non fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\\\\r\\\\nshare of that. It was more a feeling of duty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a feeling that some good\\\\r\\\\nmight come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ninstinct; perhaps it was woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instinct which gave me that feeling.\\\\r\\\\nAt any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\\\\r\\\\nchance to pass the forbidden door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\\\\r\\\\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\\\\r\\\\nthese deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\\\\r\\\\nbag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\\\\r\\\\nyesterday evening he was very drunk; and, when I came up-stairs, there\\\\r\\\\nwas the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it\\\\r\\\\nthere. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down-stairs, and the child was\\\\r\\\\nwith them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key\\\\r\\\\ngently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\\\\r\\\\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\\\\r\\\\nwere three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\\\\r\\\\nThey each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\\\\r\\\\nin the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\\\\r\\\\nlight glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\\\\r\\\\nacross the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of\\\\r\\\\nan iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened\\\\r\\\\nat the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and\\\\r\\\\nthe key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with\\\\r\\\\nthe shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\\\\r\\\\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\\\\r\\\\nskylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\\\\r\\\\ngazing at the sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil,\\\\r\\\\nI suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow\\\\r\\\\npass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which\\\\r\\\\nshone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in\\\\r\\\\nme at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly,\\\\r\\\\nand I turned and ran\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\\\\r\\\\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\\\\r\\\\nthe door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\\\\r\\\\noutside.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98So,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, smiling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98it was you, then. I thought that it must be\\\\r\\\\nwhen I saw the door open.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh, I am so frightened!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I panted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94you cannot think how\\\\r\\\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98and what has frightened you, my\\\\r\\\\ndear young lady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\\\\r\\\\nkeenly on my guard against him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98But it\\\\r\\\\nis so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\\\\r\\\\nout again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Only that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 said he, looking at me keenly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why, what did you think?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Why do you think that I lock this door?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am sure that I do not know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 He\\\\r\\\\nwas still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I am sure if I had known\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\\\\r\\\\nthreshold again\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\\\\r\\\\nrage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll throw\\\\r\\\\nyou to the mastiff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\\\\r\\\\nmust have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\\\\r\\\\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\\\\r\\\\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\\\\r\\\\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\\\\r\\\\neven of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\\\\r\\\\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\\\\r\\\\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\\\\r\\\\nmade up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\\\\r\\\\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\\\\r\\\\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\\\\r\\\\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\\\\r\\\\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\\\\r\\\\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\\\\r\\\\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\\\\r\\\\nfree. I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at\\\\r\\\\nthe thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\\\\r\\\\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\r\\\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\\\\r\\\\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\\\\r\\\\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\\\\r\\\\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\\\\r\\\\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\\\\r\\\\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs Toller still drunk?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\\\\r\\\\nwith him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, the wine-cellar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\\\\r\\\\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one\\\\r\\\\nmore feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\\\\r\\\\nexceptional woman.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will try. What is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, my friend and I.\\\\r\\\\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\\\\r\\\\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\\\\r\\\\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\\\\r\\\\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will do it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\\\\r\\\\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\\\\r\\\\npersonate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\\\\r\\\\nThat is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\\\\r\\\\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said\\\\r\\\\nto have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her\\\\r\\\\nin height, figure, and the color of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\\\\r\\\\nvery possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\\\\r\\\\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\\\\r\\\\nupon her tresses. The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of\\\\r\\\\nhers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94possibly her _fianc\\\\xc3\\\\xa9_\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and no doubt, as you wore the girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dress\\\\r\\\\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever\\\\r\\\\nhe saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\\\\r\\\\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\\\\r\\\\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate\\\\r\\\\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\\\\r\\\\nis the disposition of the child.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d I ejaculated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\\\\r\\\\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see\\\\r\\\\nthat the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\\\\r\\\\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\\\\r\\\\nThis child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\\\\r\\\\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\\\\r\\\\ntheir power.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried our client. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA\\\\r\\\\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have\\\\r\\\\nhit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\\\r\\\\ncreature.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\\\\r\\\\ncan do nothing until seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\\\\r\\\\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\\\\r\\\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house. The\\\\r\\\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\\\\r\\\\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\\\\r\\\\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you managed it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Holmes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is\\\\r\\\\nMrs. Toller in the cellar,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHer husband lies snoring on\\\\r\\\\nthe kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\\\r\\\\nRucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have done well indeed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow lead\\\\r\\\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\\\\r\\\\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\\\\r\\\\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\\\\r\\\\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\\\\r\\\\nfrom within, and at the silence Holmes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face clouded over.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI trust that we are not too late,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think, Miss Hunter,\\\\r\\\\nthat we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\\\\r\\\\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united\\\\r\\\\nstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no\\\\r\\\\nfurniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of\\\\r\\\\nlinen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere has been some villainy here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis beauty has\\\\r\\\\nguessed Miss Hunter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s intentions, and has carried his victim off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He swung\\\\r\\\\nhimself up onto the roof. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the end of a\\\\r\\\\nlong light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it is impossible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Miss Hunter; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe ladder was not there\\\\r\\\\nwhen the Rucastles went away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\\\r\\\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\\\\r\\\\nwhose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\\\\r\\\\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\\\\r\\\\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\\\\r\\\\nhand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\\\\r\\\\nhim, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou villain!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said he, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your daughter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is for me to ask you that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shrieked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou thieves! Spies and\\\\r\\\\nthieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll serve\\\\r\\\\nyou!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone for the dog!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Miss Hunter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have my revolver,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said I.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter close the front door,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down\\\\r\\\\nthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\\\\r\\\\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\\\\r\\\\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\\\\r\\\\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy God!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome one has loosed the dog. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not been fed for\\\\r\\\\ntwo days. Quick, quick, or it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be too late!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\\\\r\\\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\\\r\\\\nburied in Rucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\\\\r\\\\nground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\\\\r\\\\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\\\\r\\\\nmuch labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly\\\\r\\\\nmangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and,\\\\r\\\\nhaving despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\\\\r\\\\ndid what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\\\\r\\\\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs. Toller!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Miss Hunter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went\\\\r\\\\nup to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let me know what you were\\\\r\\\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller\\\\r\\\\nknows more about this matter than any one else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points\\\\r\\\\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will soon make it clear to you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said she; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have done\\\\r\\\\nso before now if I could ha\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 got out from the cellar. If there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\npolice-court business over this, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll remember that I was the one\\\\r\\\\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friend too.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, from the time that\\\\r\\\\nher father married again. She was slighted like, and had no say in\\\\r\\\\nanything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met\\\\r\\\\nMr. Fowler at a friend\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice\\\\r\\\\nhad rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she\\\\r\\\\nwas, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in\\\\r\\\\nMr. Rucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was\\\\r\\\\na chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the\\\\r\\\\nlaw would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on\\\\r\\\\nit. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not,\\\\r\\\\nhe could use her money. When she wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it, he kept on worrying\\\\r\\\\nher until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s door.\\\\r\\\\nThen she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\\\r\\\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make no change in her young\\\\r\\\\nman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think that what you have been good enough to\\\\r\\\\ntell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all\\\\r\\\\nthat remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\\\\r\\\\nimprisonment?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\\\r\\\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was it, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should\\\\r\\\\nbe, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain\\\\r\\\\narguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests\\\\r\\\\nwere the same as his.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mrs.\\\\r\\\\nToller, serenely.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\\\\r\\\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\\\r\\\\nhad gone out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Holmes, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor you\\\\r\\\\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\\\\r\\\\nthe country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\\\\r\\\\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\\\\r\\\\n_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\\\\r\\\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\\\r\\\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\\\\r\\\\nThey still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\\\\r\\\\nRucastle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.\\\\r\\\\nMr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\\\\r\\\\nSouthampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\\\\r\\\\nGovernment appointment in the Island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet\\\\r\\\\nHunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\\\\r\\\\nfurther interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\\\\r\\\\none of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\\\\r\\\\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE END\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBY W.

It exists\\\\r\\\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\\\r\\\\npeople in all walks of life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\\\r\\\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\\\r\\\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\\\r\\\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\\\r\\\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\\\r\\\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\\\r\\\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\\\r\\\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\\\r\\\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\\\r\\\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\\\r\\\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\\\r\\\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\\\r\\\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\\\r\\\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\\\r\\\\nstatus with the IRS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\\\r\\\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\\\r\\\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\\\r\\\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\\\r\\\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\\\r\\\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\\\r\\\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\\\r\\\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\\\r\\\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\\\r\\\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\\\r\\\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\\\r\\\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\\\r\\\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\\\r\\\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\\\r\\\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSection 5.
